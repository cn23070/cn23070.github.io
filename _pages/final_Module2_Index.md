Welcome to the index page for **Module 2**. Here you'll find key reflections, deliverables, and insights related to this topic.

*Module 2 will cover the impact of cyber security on network systems and designs, focusing especially on network vulnerability assessments. We will discuss techniques that can be used to scan, evaluate and in some case mitigate network vulnerabilities. It also will consider the area of vulnerability assessments and explain the various mechanisms and approaches encapsulated in the Vulnerability Assessment Continuum.*

## üóÇÔ∏è Module Summary:

This module provided a comprehensive overview of the core principles and practices involved in securing information networks and systems. It began by developing a solid understanding of vulnerability assessments, exploring their application across various system environments to identify, evaluate, and mitigate security weaknesses.

Learners gained insights into the provision of security in information networks, covering essential concepts such as network protocols, architectures, and security models. The module also examined the roles and benefits of monitoring and logging tools, emphasizing their importance in proactive threat detection and incident response.

Practical components of the module focused on the development and application of security assessment tools, enabling learners to simulate real-world scenarios and strengthen their hands-on technical skills.

In addition to technical competencies, the module supported learners in developing critical communication skills, encouraging the presentation of reasoned arguments and recommendations to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Finally, the module incorporated reflective activities that enabled learners to evaluate their progress and consider their personal and professional development in the context of cybersecurity practices.
