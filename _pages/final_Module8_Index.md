## üóÇÔ∏è Module Summary:

This module provided an essential foundation in research methodology tailored to computing disciplines. It emphasized the development of academic research skills grounded in the scientific method, with a focus on designing, conducting, and evaluating independent investigations.

Students explored a wide range of research strategies, including qualitative and quantitative methods for data collection and analysis. A critical component of the module involved evaluating existing literature and assessing the validity of different research designs and analytical approaches.

Ethical awareness was integral throughout, with learners examining professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical considerations relevant to computing and research. The module also encouraged reflective and independent learning, helping students to take ownership of their academic development.

By the end of the module, students demonstrated the ability to apply research principles to a chosen topic, and to develop and critically evaluate a research proposal with clarity and academic rigour.
