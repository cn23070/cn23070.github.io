## 🌐 Reflective Activity 1
# **Ethics in Computing in the Age of Generative AI**

---

### 🧭 Introduction

Corrêa et al. (2023) conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of **200 governance policies and ethical guidelines** for AI usage published by various entities worldwide, including:

| 🌍 Entity Type             |
|---------------------------|
| 🏛️ Public Bodies          |
| 🎓 Academic Institutions  |
| 🏢 Private Companies       |
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Civil Society Orgs   |

The study aimed to identify **common principles and areas of consensus** that could inform future regulatory efforts. The authors found **17 prevalent principles**, such as:

- 🔍 Transparency
- 🧾 Accountability
- 🔐 Privacy
- ⚖️ Fairness

These are crucial for ethical AI governance.

Given the diverse approaches to AI governance, I believe:

- ✅ A focus on **areas of consensus** should be prioritized
- 🔄 **Contentious areas** should be worked through for better alignment
- ⚖️ **Risk-based frameworks** should guide global objectives 
- 🌐 **International organizations** like the **UN** and **WHO** should be leveraged

> *"AI governance within the UN system should focus on ethical considerations, international cooperation, and leveraging existing normative frameworks."*
