## Reflective Activity 1 Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI

* In the Correa et al (2023) paper, the authors state that “a lot of work is taking place to define the values and ideas that should guide AI advances. A key challenge, however, lies in establishing a consensus on these values, given the diverse perspectives of various stakeholders worldwide and the abstraction of normative discourse. Researchers and policy makers need better tools to catalogue and compare AI governance documents from around the world and to identify points of divergence and commonality.” After reviewing the article and reading how different countries across the world deal with the generative AI revolution, discuss your views on the subject and recommend what you think could be a suitable course of action.. *


##  Introduction

Corrêa et al. (2023) conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 200 governance policies and ethical guidelines for AI usage published by various entities worldwide, including public bodies, academic institutions, private companies, and civil society organizations. The study aimed to identify common principles and areas of consensus that could inform future regulatory efforts. The authors found 17 prevalent principles, such as transparency, accountability, privacy, and fairness, which are crucial for ethical AI governance.

### Discussion on Global Approaches to AI Governance
Different countries have adopted varied approaches to AI governance, reflecting their unique legal, social, and cultural contexts. For instance, the European Union approach to AI focuses on  excellence and trust, aiming to boost research and industrial capacity while ensuring safety and fundamental rights European Commission, 2025). It has been proactive in establishing comprehensive AI regulations, emphasizing human rights and ethical considerations. In contrast, the United States has taken a more decentralized approach, with guidelines and recommendations emerging from various federal agencies and industry groups. The focus in the U.S. has been on promoting innovation while addressing ethical concerns through voluntary frameworks and industry standards
The RAND Corporation paper compares U.S. and Chinese AI governance approaches, noting key differences in domestic regulation focus, principles, and international governance implementation (RAND Corporation, 2023).

### Personal Views and Recommendations
Given the diverse approaches to AI governance, I believe a focus on areas of consesus should be priortised, whilst in parallel areas of contetion worked through with the aim of better allignment. Risk should be leveraged in order to determine objective and agreed areas to further advance globally, and existing international organisations and their functions such as the UNited Nations and World Health Organisation should be leveraged to facilaite this work. This view is supported by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Artificial Intelligence (2024), who states that AI governance within the UN system should focus on ethical considerations, international cooperation, and leveraging existing normative frameworks.

### Justification from Literature

The work by Corrêa et al. (2023) provides an oppurtuntiy for the international community to focus on common principles and areas of consensus that could inform future regulatory efforts.

Both the OECD AI Principles and he Deloitte AI Governance Roadmap (2024) further support this by also highlighting and promoting a number of the same common AI priciples including transparency and explainability, security and reliability, as well as fairness and privacy. 


### Impact on Legal, Social, and Professional Issues
Implementing a balanced AI governance strategy would have several implications:

#### Legal Issues
Compliance: Ensuring AI systems comply with existing laws and regulations, such as data protection and anti-discrimination laws.
Liability: Clarifying liability for AI-related harms, which is crucial for accountability and trust.

#### Social Issues
Equity: Promoting fairness and reducing biases in AI systems to prevent discrimination and ensure equitable access to AI benefits.
Public Trust: Building public trust in AI through transparency and accountability measures.

#### Professional Issues
Ethical Standards: Establishing clear ethical standards for AI professionals to guide responsible AI development and deployment.
Skill Development: Investing in education and training for AI professionals to ensure they are equipped to handle 
ethical and governance challenges.


### Conclusion
In conclusion, a balanced approach to AI governance that combines regulatory oversight with industry self-regulation is essential for addressing the ethical, legal, social, and professional challenges posed by AI. By drawing on the principles identified by Corrêa et al. (2023) and other relevant literature, we can develop robust governance frameworks that promote responsible AI use while fostering innovation.
