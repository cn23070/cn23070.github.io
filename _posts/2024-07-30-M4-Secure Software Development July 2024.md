## Introduction

When taking on the module Secure Software Development, I was excited to learn more about developing secure applications, but also apprehensive about any coding knowledge required as I had little coding experience to date.

![Module Introduction](/Modules/4/img/3.png)

- **Figure 1**: Module Introduction (University of Essex Online, 2024)

#### Unit 1

We began with background research around the principles of software architecture and secure coding with python. 

![Module Core Reading](/Modules/4/img/1.png)

- **Figure 2**: Module Core Reading (Pillai, 2017)

The reading provided clarification on the difference between software architecture and software design. According to Pillai (2017), software architecture is a description of a software system, and the relationships between them. Software Design covers the organization of parts of the sub system involved in making the system. 

We also covered secure coding including common vulnerabilities to address such as overflow errors, lack of validation input and poor access controls. 

Finally, unit 1 provided a lecturecast on secure development.

![Lecturecast 1: Introduction to Secure Software Development](/Modules/4/img/4.png)

- **Figure 4**: Lecturecast 1: Introduction to Secure Software Development (University of Essex Online, 2024)

The lecturecast begun with areminder of the improtance of cyber crime as a problem today.

![Lecturecast 1: Cost of Cybercrime by Vector](/Modules/4/img/5.png)

- **Figure 5**: Lecturecast 1: Cost of Cybercrime by Vector (University of Essex Online, 2024)

I then learnt more about OWASP and the benefits of following OWASP best practices during application design.

![Lecturecast 1: OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls](/Modules/4/img/6.png)

- **Figure 6**: Lecturecast 1: OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls (University of Essex Online, 2024)

####  Unit 2

Unit 2 continued building on UML knowledge, providing practical skills in the creation of UML flow charts through a blog activity. We submitted a UML diagram for a given scenario and then took and provided feedback from our peers. The feedback I received was positive and I enjoyed their expansive input to my initial justification post.

![Module 2 Activity: Collaborative Discussion: UML flowchart](/Modules/4/img/13.png)
- **Figure x**: Collaborative Discussion: UML flowchart (University of Essex Online, 2024)

We got to select a UML model to try. Once done we then uploaded them for peer review and had a collaborative discussion around them.

During the live seminar we learnt mroe on how to align secure coding best practice to the agile development methodology, and familiarised ourselves with ISO 27000 by posting a blog using the ISO terminology.

![Module 2 Activity: Unit 2 Seminar Blog Post](/Modules/4/img/14.png)
- **Figure x**: Unit 2 Seminar Blog Post (University of Essex Online, 2024)



#### Unit 3

The next unit took us through programming languages in detail via a lecturecast that looked at the history, concepts and design that led to the languages in use today.

![Lecturecast 2: Programming Languages and Testing](/Modules/4/img/15.png)

- **Figure 4**: Lecturecast 2: Programming Languages and Testing (University of Essex Online, 2024)

![Lecturecast 2: History](/Modules/4/img/18.png)

- **Figure 4**: Lecturecast 2: History (University of Essex Online, 2024)


![Lecturecast 2: Testing](/Modules/4/img/16.png)

- **Figure 4**: Lecturecast 2: Testing (University of Essex Online, 2024)

![Lecturecast 2: Blackbox & Whitebox Testing](/Modules/4/img/17.png)

- **Figure 4**: Lecturecast 2: Blackbox & Whitebox Testing (University of Essex Online, 2024)

Some key learning include:

- Test early into the development process, and test often throughout the life cycle (OWASP)
- Think like the attacker when defining tests
- Leverage frameworks like UML to ensure use cases are understood and agreed
- Include the following into your testing techniques: developer interviews, threat modelling, source code reviews and penetration testing (white and black)

We also submitted our first assignment, a team project that required us to submit a proposed design report for an application that can be used as a secure enclave to store lyrics, music scores and musical recordings. 

- **Figure 4**: Assignment 1: Design Document (University of Essex Online, 2024)

![Assignment 1: Design Document](/Modules/4/img/19.png)

The project was fun, and our team worked well together to produce a quality submission, even though we faced time zone and business travel challenges.


#### Unit 4

Next, we learnt about testing software, both for general quality and security using Linters and Python. 

We ran pylint against several python scripts and learnt how it tests for errors in the code and returns the results.

- **Figure 4**: Running Pylint (Pylint 3.3.0-dev0 documentation, 2024)

![Running Pylint](/Modules/4/img/20.png)


#### Unit 5

During unit 5 we researched the security properties of today’s programming languages. We worked through the strengths and weaknesses of programming languages from the security perspective, and the ways in which they may need to be extended. We compared the strengths and weaknesses of Python against Rust, Swift and F#.

![Lecturecast 3: Future Trends](/Modules/4/img/21.png)

- **Figure 4**: Lecturecast 2: Future Trends (University of Essex Online, 2024)

DUring the lecturecast we also about future trends including Blockchain, Fog Computing, the Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems.

I found the overview of blockchain interesting and insightful. Blockchain is a relatively new technology that brings together encryption, distributed peer-to-peer networks and consensus mechanisms. If the technology can overcome its cost, it has the potential to disrupt a number of industries including healthcare and finance, and will likely become a significant technology disruptor over time.

![Lecturecast 3: Fog Computing](/Modules/4/img/23.png)

- **Figure 4**: Lecturecast 2: Fog Computing (University of Essex Online, 2024)


#### Unit 6

We then concluded the module by learning about future trends in the areas of secure design, development, programming languages and operating systems. 

We also submitted the final assignments that required us to implement the application which we designed in Unit 3, as well provide a reflection report on the module overall.

#### Conclusion

Learning how to code and test an application using Python was fun, challenging, insightful and something I will take away as a new skillset to use during my current cyber work activities.

##Notes##


### Unit 1: Introduction to Secure Software Development

We begun the module with background core reading. Unit 1 reading covered two key topics:
- Principles of Software Architecture
- Writing Secure Code

![Module Core Reading](/Modules/4/img/1.png)

- **Figure 2**: Module Core Reading (Pillai, 2017)

#### Principles of Software Architecture
- Defining software architecture: According to Pillai (2017), software architecture is a description of the subsystems or components of a software system, and the relationships between them.

**Software architecture versus design**

Although used interchangeably, Pillai (2017) argues that there are distinctions:
 
- Software Architecture (higher abstraction / larger scope) is about the design of the entire system.
	- It covers the higher level structures and interactions of the system and is closer to questions about the systems functional, technical, organizational, business and quality attributes, 

- Wheras Software Design covers the organization of parts of the sub system and system invovled in making the system
	 - Mostly about the details of the subsystems
	 - It is closer to questions around the code itself

• Aspects of software architecture include a System(collection of components orangazed in such a way as to achieve a specific function), Structure (set of software or hardware elements grouped together accordign to a guiding principle), Enviroment (context(technical, business, operational ...) or circumstances in which a system is built), and Stakeholders (person(s0 who is interested in or concered about the success of the system.))

**Characteristics of software architecture**

An Architecture of a system: 

- is represented as structual details. of the sytem, often depicted using a class diagram
- picks a core set of elements and does not setout to document everything about every component of the system
- captures early design decisions based on requirements and constraints of its context. These decisionsplay a major role in further development
- manages stakeholders requirements
- influences the organizational structure
- is influenced by its enviroment. The envioment often imposes limits that the architecture must function within.
- documents the system (stakeholders, requirements, decisions) and often conforms to a pattern (architecture patterns include client server, pipes and filters ect..)

**Why is software architecture important?**
- A number of reasons including technical aspects such as helping manage changes, ensuring component based design, and facilitates early prototyping. I also an architecture balances and optimizes stakeholder requirements and formalises it, helping ensure good documentation best pratice as well as producing a system that is etensible and moifiable.


We also reviewed our first case study, a paper by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019),that illustrates some of the risks introduced by industry 4.0 when applying digitalisation to more traditional business processes. The study also covered a methodology for carrying out the risk assessment of the digitalisation process as well as some common definitions of risk.

#### Writing Secure Code

**Information security architecture**
A secure architecture involves creating a system that is able to provide access to data and information to authorized people and systems while preventing any unauthorized access.(Pillai, 2017)

You protect the CIA of the system and its data through security mechanisms such as authetication, authorization and non-reputability

**Secure coding**

Secure coding is the practice of software development that guards programs against security vulnerabilities, and makes it resistant to malicious attacks right from program design to implementation.(Pillai, 2017). It is important to identify assets of value (code/data), then decompose the application into components followed by identifying and categorizing threats to each asset or component and ranking the threats following a risk model. You should then develop strategies to mitigate the identifed threats

**Common security vulnerabilities**

*Overflow errors* such as *buffer overflow*(attackers take control of systems by gaining access to teh systems application stack or heap memory due to code error allowing an application to write past the end of a buffer), and *Integer or arithmetic overflow* (an operation on an integerproduces a result that is too large to be used or stored)

*Lack of validated input* (comon security issue on web application where unvalidated input is injected by an attacker, tricking the system into accepting malicious code or system commands leading to system compromise)
Common examples include Cross-Site-Scripting(XSS), SQL Injections and Shel Execution Exploits.

*Poor Access control* (lack of seperation of super user rights between user groups may be leveraged by an attacker through things like exposed routes (URLs) or workflows)

**Is Python secure?**
°° Reading input
°° Evaluating arbitrary input
°° Overflow errors
°° Serializing objects
°° Security issues with web applications

Unit 1 also provided a lecturecast that provided an introduction to Secure Software Development. 

![Lecturecast 1: Introduction to Secure Software Development](/Modules/4/img/4.png)

- **Figure 4**: Lecturecast 1: Introduction to Secure Software Development (University of Essex Online, 2024)

The lecturecast begun with areminder of the improtance of cyber crime as a problem today.


![Lecturecast 1: Cost of Cybercrime by Vector](/Modules/4/img/5.png)

- **Figure 5**: Lecturecast 1: Cost of Cybercrime by Vector (University of Essex Online, 2024)

I then learnt more about OWASP and the benefits of following OWASP best practices during application design.

![Lecturecast 1: OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls](/Modules/4/img/6.png)

- **Figure 6**: Lecturecast 1: OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls (University of Essex Online, 2024)

The lecturecast also helped me to gain an understanding of the differences between the predictive (Waterfall) and adaptive (Agile) approaches to software development


![Lecturecast 1: Software Development Lifecycles](/Modules/4/img/8.png)

- **Figure 7**: Lecturecast 1: Software Development Lifecycles (University of Essex Online, 2024)

This included an appreciation of the challenges of integrating security practices into both the adaptive and predictive approaches to software development

![Lecturecast 1: Benefits of design patterns](/Modules/4/img/11.png)

- **Figure 11**: Lecturecast 1: Benefits of design patterns (University of Essex Online, 2024)

Finally, I also learnt about Unified Modelling Language (UML), inlcuding how UML is alligned to SDLC.

![Lecturecast 1: Relating UML Models to SDLC](/Modules/4/img/7.png)

- **Figure 12**: Lecturecast 1: Relating UML Models to SDLC (University of Essex Online, 2024)



### Unit 2 UML Modelling to Support Secure System Planning

During unit 2 I gained some experiance creating Uniﬁed Modelling Language (UML) flowcharts in order to assist in the design of software. UML, a consolidation of the best practices refined over time, provides a way to present the diverse elements of a software system (e.g., requirements, data structures, data ﬂows, and information ﬂows) within a single framework (Seidl et al., 2015). 

![Module 2 Activity: Collaborative Discussion: UML flowchart](/Modules/4/img/13.png)
- **Figure x**: Collaborative Discussion: UML flowchart (University of Essex Online, 2024)

We got to select a UML model to try. Once done we then uploaded them for peer review and had a collaborative discussion around them.

During the live seminar we learnt mroe on how to align secure coding best practice to the agile development methodology, and familiarised ourselves with ISO 27000 by posting a blog using the ISO terminology.

- **Figure x**: Unit 2 Seminar Blog Post (University of Essex Online, 2024)

### Unit 3: Introduction to Programming Languages

During unit 3 we spent time investigating programming languages including the history, concepts and design that led to the languages we have today. 

We completed a lecturecast on Programming Languages and Testing. The lecturecast helped me to better describe some key milestones in the development of programming languages, be able to outline some of the key paradigms that define the different types of languages, and describe the different testing strategies and when to apply them.

![Lecturecast 2: Programming Languages and Testing](/Modules/4/img/15.png)

![Lecturecast 2: History](/Modules/4/img/18.png)

- **Figure 4**: Lecturecast 2: History (University of Essex Online, 2024)


![Lecturecast 2: Testing](/Modules/4/img/16.png)

- **Figure 4**: Lecturecast 2: Testing (University of Essex Online, 2024)

![Lecturecast 2: Blackbox & Whitebox Testing](/Modules/4/img/17.png)

- **Figure 4**: Lecturecast 2: Blackbox & Whitebox Testing (University of Essex Online, 2024)

Some key learning include:

- Test early into the development process, and test often throughout the life cycle (OWASP)
- Think like the attacker when defining tests
- Leverage frameworks like UML to ensure use cases are understood and agreed
- Include the following into your testing techniques: developer interviews, threat modelling, source code reviews and penetration testing (white and black)

Finally we submitted our team project assignment, a high-level design document. The design was for a proposed application, which provides secure storage, integrity validation, and role-based access control for music-related artefacts including lyrics, music scores, and recordings.

- **Figure 4**: Assignment 1: Design Document (University of Essex Online, 2024)

![Assignment 1: Design Document](/Modules/4/img/19.png)

### Unit 4: Introduction to Testing


During unit 4 I gained experiance with using linters for testing Python code. We ran pylint against a number of python scripts and learnt how it tests for errors in the code and returns the results.

![Running Pylint](/Modules/4/img/20.png)


### Unit 5: Future trends in Secure Software Development

We then moved onto looking to the future trends in the areas of secure design, development, programming languages and operating systems. 

We began with a lecturecast on the topic

![Lecturecast 3: Future Trends](/Modules/4/img/21.png)

- **Figure 4**: Lecturecast 2: Future Trends (University of Essex Online, 2024)

Here I learnt about future trends in this space including Blockchain, Fog Computing, the Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems.

I found the overview of blockchain interesting and insightful. Blockchain is a relatively new technology that brings together encryption, distributed peer-to-peer networks and consensus mechanisms. If the technology can overcome its cost, it has the potential to disrupt a number of industries including healthcare and finance, and will likely become a significant technology disruptor over time.

### Unit 6: The Security of Programming Languages Debate

 During the final unit, we researched the security properties of todays programming languages. We worked through the strengths and weaknesses of programming languages from the security perspective, and the ways in which they may need to be extended.In particular we compared the stregths and weaknesses of Python against Rust, Swift and F#.

 We then conlcuded the module with submission of the final assignment that required us to implement the application which you designed in Unit 3 using Python. Learning how to code and test an application using Python was insightful and something I will take away into my current cyber work activities.
