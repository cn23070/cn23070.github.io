## 🔹 WHAT? – Description of the Learning Events

This module provided a rich blend of theory, reflection, and applied learning that strengthened my academic confidence and practical readiness for dissertation research.

In Units 1 to 4, I built a solid foundation in research methods and ethics, learning about the scientific method, reasoning types, and ethical principles in computing, such as integrity and respect for participants. These insights will guide me in conducting credible research. 

I also gained practical experience through a peer review (Activity 2) and developing a literature review on IoT cybersecurity threats (Activity 3).

The **peer review seminar** (Activity 2) was particularly helpful, as it strengthened my ability to critically assess academic research by analysing methodology, design, and data use in computing papers, while building key skills for conducting my own research.

This experience allowed me to explore the academic treatment of topics I typically encounter in my professional role.

Ethical issues in computing were explored through reflective analysis of **Generative AI** (Activity 1) and the **Cambridge Analytica Scandal** (Case Study), both of which raised critical questions about organisational accountability.

We further expanded our understanding of ethical considerations through peer discussion forum activities, where we applied the relevant code of ethics to a specific scenario and examined its implications for those involved.

These discussions further deepened our insight as we critically analysed and openly debated relevant legal (both jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional) and social issues, along with the level of professionalism demonstrated by the computing professionals in the case.


I also gained skills in formulating clear, focused research questions. I now understand how to critically evaluate sources, identify gaps in existing knowledge, and structure a review to support my research objectives.

I explored different research designs (exploratory and conclusive), and learned to distinguish between qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches. Unit 4 introduced key qualitative data collection techniques such as case studies, focus groups, and observations, and highlighted the value of combining methods for richer insights.

Throughout Units 5 to 12, I developed a comprehensive understanding of research methods, data analysis, and academic writing within the context of computing. I learned how to design effective data collection tools such as surveys and questionnaires, and gained practical skills in both qualitative and quantitative research techniques. I explored descriptive and inferential statistics, learning how to interpret data, test hypotheses, and draw meaningful conclusions.

I also enhanced my ability to present data clearly through visualisation tools and dashboards, and to critically assess the validity, reliability, and generalisability of research findings. The focus on research writing helped me structure and communicate my ideas effectively, culminating in the development of a research proposal. I subsequently developed a structured **research proposal** (Assignment 2), which introduced a refined research topic that I intend to expand upon in my MSc dissertation.

Additionally, I reflected on my learning journey through the e-Portfolio, which supported my professional development and employability.

Finally, I gained insight into project management principles, particularly in managing risk and change in computing projects.

All of this was summarised in my **professional skills matrix and SWOT analysis** (Skills Matrix), helping me identify competencies I’ve strengthened and those I must still address.

Looking ahead, I will apply these skills directly to my dissertation by designing a robust research methodology, selecting appropriate data collection and analysis techniques, and ensuring my work meets high standards of academic integrity and rigour. The ability to critically evaluate literature, structure a research project, and communicate findings clearly will be essential in producing a well-founded and impactful dissertation.

## 🔹 SO WHAT? – Interpretation of the Learning Experience

These activities taught me that academic rigour requires a level of methodical precision that is distinct from professional reporting. For instance, building the literature review made me appreciate the value of identifying theoretical gaps and synthesising multiple perspectives, rather than relying solely on practical methods.

The research proposal taught me how to frame research questions in a way that ensures measurability and ethical transparency. It also made me aware of how my professional assumptions can introduce bias into how I define problems or design solutions. Recognising this will enhance the rigour of my academic work and improve my effectiveness in professional leadership.

The peer review process helped me refine my ability to deliver and accept feedback, improving my confidence in academic debate. It also reinforced the importance of tone and critical balance when reviewing the work of others, a skill often overlooked in workplace evaluations.

Ethically, case studies on Generative AI and Cambridge Analytica introduced structured reasoning frameworks, expanding my thinking beyond policy compliance into social responsibility.

The statistical components, though challenging, were meaningful. I realised I lacked the analytical grounding to confidently interpret distributions and build inferences, a shortfall I wouldn’t have identified without this module’s practical tasks.

Lastly, the requirement to reflect continuously encouraged me to think more intentionally about **how** I learn. The e-Portfolio process forced me to make connections between theoretical models and real-life application, enhancing both depth and transferability.

## 🔹 NOW WHAT? – Application and Future Development

The skills developed in this module will directly inform and underpin my upcoming **MSc dissertation**, which I hope to base on the same research topic proposed in Assignment 2. This continuity will allow me to refine and extend my original methodology using the academic frameworks and ethical considerations explored throughout this module.

I plan to refine my dissertation using my literature review, improve my research proposal's clarity and methods, apply ethics in data collection, and use tools like Python or Excel for evidence-based analysis. I will also continue reflective journaling to enhance academic focus and leadership awareness.

In summary, this module has not only equipped me with the tools to produce a credible dissertation but has also elevated the academic quality of my thinking and practice.
