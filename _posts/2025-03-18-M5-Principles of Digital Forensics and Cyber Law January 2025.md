## Case Study: Data Privacy Issues in the United Kingdom
#### Issue: NHS Data Sharing Controversy
In January 2025, the UK government faced a backlash over plans to share NHS patient data with private companies for research purposes. The proposal aimed to leverage NHS patient data for medical advancements but raised significant concerns about patient privacy and consent (The Conversation, 2023).

#### Breach of Human Rights
The controversy reflects potential breaches of the right to privacy. Sharing sensitive health data without explicit patient consent can violate individuals' privacy rights and undermine trust in public institutions. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 emphasize the importance of consent and transparency in data handling (GOV.UK, 2025).

#### Justifiability Against Competing Interests
The government's proposal can be justified by the potential benefits of medical research and advancements. Access to large datasets can accelerate the development of treatments and improve public health outcomes. However, the lack of clear consent mechanisms and transparency raises ethical concerns and questions about the balance between public interest and individual rights (Pinsent Masons, 2025).

#### Jurisdictional Protection
The UK has robust data protection laws, including the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, which provide frameworks for safeguarding personal data. These laws require organizations to obtain explicit consent for data sharing and ensure transparency in data handling practices (GOV.UK, 2025).

#### Effectiveness of Protection
The effectiveness of these protections is contingent on strict enforcement and adherence to legal requirements. The NHS data sharing proposal highlights gaps in consent and transparency, suggesting that existing protections may not be fully effective. Strengthening oversight and ensuring compliance with data protection laws are essential for safeguarding privacy rights (Pinsent Masons, 2025).

#### Alternative Resolutions
Alternative resolutions include enhancing patient consent processes and increasing transparency in data sharing practices. Implementing robust anonymization techniques can protect patient identities while enabling valuable research. Additionally, engaging with stakeholders, including patients and advocacy groups, can help address concerns and build trust in data sharing initiatives (Statista, 2025). The controversy surrounding the involvement of Palantir, a US tech company, in NHS data management has further fuelled privacy concerns and public distrust (The Conversation, 2023).
