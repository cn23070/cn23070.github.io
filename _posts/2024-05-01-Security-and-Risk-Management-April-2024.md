*Module 3 will cover the various areas where security and risk overlap and interact with each other. It will review the various methods of risk assessment, looking at both qualitative and quantitative methods.*


## Module 1: Learning Scope & Objectives

*‚ÄúAll human endeavors involve uncertainty and risk.‚Äù(Olson, D.L. & Desheng D.W, 2020)*

- Discuss the difference between qualitative and quantitative risk assessments.
- Describe how to carry out both kinds of assessments.
	- Objective: Ability to describe when to use qualitative and quantitative risk assessments.
- Explain what is meant by and how to create threat models.
	- Objective: Ability to create threat models for various scenarios.
- Demonstrate how to create quantitative risk models.
	- Objective: Ability to create quantitative risk models.
- Discuss and design DR solutions.
	- Objective: Design and explain DR strategies and solutions.
	
### Unit 1: An Introduction to Security and Risk Management

####Unit 1: Learning Objectives

- Understand the various definitions of risk.
- Ability to explain how to assess, qualify and mitigate risks.
- Describe various approaches to quantify and qualify risks.
- List common security and risk standards and select the appropriate one(s) for a given situation.

####Unit 1: Reflections

Unit 1 provided a lecturecast that covered each learning objective in detail. Through the lecturecast I learnt a number of key terminology used in risk, and further developed my understanding on risk definitions by looking at the evolution of the definition over time and how context and situation influences the definition.The Lecturecast also introduced myself to the OpenFAIR and OCTAVE Framework's.
We also reviewed our first case study, a paper by Kovaitƒó and Stankeviƒçienƒó (2019),that illustrates some of the risks introduced by industry 4.0 when applying digitalisation to more traditional business processes. The study also covered a methodology for carrying out the risk assessment of the digitalisation process as well as some common definitions of risk.
Industry 4.0. it refers to the fourth industrial revolution and embodies the use of new technologies like the Internet of things (IoT), big data, cloud computing, robotics, and artificial intelligence, to transform traditional and manufacturing processes.
It aims to enhance and optimize manufacturing and industrial operations by decentralising communication between humans and machines and enabling autonomous collaboration between machines, devices and systems. (Kovaitƒó and Stankeviƒçienƒó, 2019).

#####Understand the various definitions of risk.

On completion of unit 1 I came away with a good understanding of what risk is, including the various definitions it known by.A key takeaway is that risk is not easy to define, as the definition if often dependant on context and situation. 
Reim, Parida, and Sj√∂din (2016) define risk ‚Äúas a combination of the probability of loss and the impact of the loss for a number of events and risks‚Äù. My simplified version of this is that risk is the probability that something may occur, and is based on the impact an likelihood of the occurrence.

#####List common security and risk standards and select the appropriate one(s) for a given situation.
