## How the Tool Works

1. **Evidence Register** – Each framework is scored against CTQs using structured evidence (peer‑reviewed + high‑quality grey literature).
2. **Weighted Sum Model (WSM)** – CTQ scores are aggregated using **normalized** weights to produce an overall ranking.
3. **Scenario Analysis** – Robustness checks allow filtering by evidence quality or applying **quality‑weighted** scoring.
