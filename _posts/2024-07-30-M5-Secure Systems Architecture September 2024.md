## Introduction

Hot off the completion of module 4: Secure Software Design, we moved onto the module Secure Software Architecture(SSA). This was another topic I started with minimal experiance at hand, and I was excited to learn more especially about distributed systems and operating systems including the role of virtualisation.

#### Unit 1

We began with an introduction to the concept of secure systems architectures, considered from the perspectives of operating systems and distributed systems, and their assocaitted security challenges.

![Module Unit 1 Introduction](/Modules/5/img/2.png)

- **Figure 2**: Unit 1 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)

The inital core reading provided research in architectural tranformations in Distributed Systems, a look at Cloud Computing, virtualisation, Storage and Networking, as well as Security in Distributed Systems.

The reading provided research in architectural tranformations in Distributed Systems, alook at Cloud Computing, virtualisation, Storage and Networking as well as Security in distributed systems.

Summary of reading learning here 

We completed an individual formative exercise where we evaluated Alternative Operating Systems that helped build on operating system knowledge. I selected MS DOS.

Finally, we also completed a unit 1 lecturecast that introduced to Secure Systems Architecture.

![Lecturecast: Introduction to Secure Systems Architecture](/Modules/5/img/4.png)

- **Figure 5**: Lecturecast: Introduction to Secure Systems Architecture (University of Essex Online, 2024)

We learnt the difference between distributed systems and operating systems, how to define the type and functions of a typical operating system, and some basic understandings of the design approaches of secure distributed systems.



####  Unit 2

Unit 2 introduced me to a number of modelling tools and languages including threat modelling and SysML. We got to build on our python skills during coding exercises implementing a distributed communication system.

![Module Unit 2 Modelling and Socket Programming](/Modules/5/img/6.png)

- **Figure 6**: Unit 2 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)


I learnt how to implement the sockets which support distributed computing using Python, with a client enabled in one process and a server enabled on the other.

During the seminar I also learnt about the AD modelling tool and how to use it for threat modelling techniques to model the threats to a system.

#### Unit 3

The next unit took us through xxx via 


![Module Unit 3 Systems Engineering and Modelling](/Modules/5/img/7.png)

- **Figure 7**: Unit 3 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)

The lecturecast taught me aspects of System Engineering. It explained the use of System modelling and describeb the different models available. I also learnt the differences between Distributed and Concurrent Systems

![Lecturecast: Systems Engineering and Modelling](/Modules/5/img/14.png)

- **Figure 5**: Lecturecast: Systems Engineering and Modelling (University of Essex Online, 2024)

Finally submitted our first assignment, a team project that required us to submit a proposed design report for a Attack-Defence Tree (AD) that models the activities associated with the networked devices in a Systems of Systems (SoS). 

- **Figure 8**: Assignment 1: Design Document (University of Essex Online, 2024)

![Assignment 1: Design Document](/Modules/5/img/xx.png)

The project was fun, and our team worked well together to produce a quality submission, even though we faced time zone and business travel challenges.


#### Unit 4

Next, we ltook on a fundamental question: Is Cybersecurity a science? Here I learnt what is meant by ‘Quality of Service’ when applied to distributed communications, and how to apply ‘The Scientific Method’ to Cybersecurity problems. The seminar was a key contributor to being able to answer this question.


![Module Unit 4 Modelling of Distributed Systems](/Modules/5/img/8.png)

- **Figure 9**: Unit 4 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)

We completed a collaborative Discussion on Solutions to the NSA/ Science of Security Hard Problems. This activity helped me identify and critically analyse operating system risks and issues, and identify appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to solve them.

#### Unit 5

During unit 5 we researched current and future challenges of Operating Systems and Distributed Systems.

![Module Unit 5 Current and Future Challenges of Operating Systems and Distributed Systems](/Modules/5/img/9.png)

- **Figure 9**: Unit 5 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)

During the lecturecast we also about future trends including Blockchain, Fog Computing, the Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems.

I found the overview of blockchain interesting and insightful. Blockchain is a relatively new technology that brings together encryption, distributed peer-to-peer networks and consensus mechanisms. If the technology can overcome its cost, it has the potential to disrupt a number of industries including healthcare and finance, and will likely become a significant technology disruptor over time.

I came away from this unit wit han appreciatiation of the challenges of running secure operating and distributed systems in the modern world.


#### Unit 6

We then concluded the module by learning more about the challenges of assessing and assuring the security of distributed systems and processes.

![Module Unit 6 Formal Modelling vs. Automated Testing](/Modules/5/img/11.png)

- **Figure 11**: Unit 6 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)


The unit seminar was fun, we got to debate Formal Modelling vs. Automated Testing. My peers shared some great perspectives on this.

#### Conclusion

Learning how to code and test an application using Python was fun, challenging, insightful and something I will take away as a new skillset to use during my current cyber work activities.
