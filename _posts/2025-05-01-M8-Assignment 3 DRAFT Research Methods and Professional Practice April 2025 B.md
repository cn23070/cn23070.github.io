## Module 8: Reflections

*Information about what I learnt during this module and how*

#### Unit 1

![Module Introduction](/Modules/8/img/1.png)

- **Figure 1**: Module Introduction (University of Essex Online, 2024)

In the first week of our unit on Research Methods, we explored the Scientific Method and ethical considerations in research. Key takeaways included understanding the purpose of research (explore, describe, explain (QuestionPro, 2021)), the importance of the scientific method for problem-solving (Andersen & Hepburn, 2020), and the two core types of reasoning: deductive and inductive (Miessler, D, 2018). 

![The Difference Between Deductive and Inductive Reasoning](/Modules/8/img/2.png)

- **Figure 2**: The Difference Between Deductive and Inductive Reasoning (Miessler, D, 2018)

Deductive reasoning moves from an idea to an observation, while inductive reasoning goes from an observation to an idea. Both are forms of inference, drawing conclusions based on evidence and reasoning. We also emphasized the importance of research ethics, requiring ethical approval before data collection, and highlighted key principles as described in the Menlo Report(2023) such as respect, beneficence, justice, and respect for law and public interest. 

Additionally, we learnt the significance of professionalism and ethics in computing.

"Ethical issues in computer science and information systems projects occur in three areas – how the research is performed, how you deal with participants and how you present your results." (Dawson, C, 2015) 

Key considerations include integrity, competence, and committment to public interest (British Computer Society (BCS), n.d.), especially in the age of generative AI.

- **Figure 3**: Top AI ethical principles and frameworks proposed by various organizations (Corrêa et al., 2023)

#### Unit 2

In Week 2, we covered defining a research question, conducting a literature review, and presenting the review.

![Lecturecast: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal](/Modules/8/img/4b.png)

- **Figure 4**: Lecturecast: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal (University of Essex Online, 2025)

![Lecturecast: Understanding Research Questions](/Modules/8/img/5.png)

- **Figure 5**: Lecturecast: Understanding Research Questions (University of Essex Online, 2025)

A key lecturecast outcome was that a good research question focuses your project, sets boundaries, guides data collection and methods, and evolves iteratively (University of Essex Online, 2025).

![Lecturecast: Mind Maps to illustrate the process](/Modules/8/img/6.png)

- **Figure 6**: Lecturecast: Mind Maps to illustrate the process (University of Essex Online, 2025)

Mind Maps start with an interest, generate questions, guide investigation steps, and lead to new discoveries.

![Lecturecast: Research Question Guidelines](/Modules/8/img/7.png)

- **Figure 7**: Research Question Guidelines (University of Essex Online, 2025)

![Lecturecast: Assessing your working research questions](/Modules/8/img/8.png)

- **Figure 8**: Assessing your working research questions (University of Essex Online, 2025)

A key lecturecast learning outcome was that a good research question focuses your project, guiding readers to the specific subject within a broad topic. It sets boundaries, determines necessary data and methods, and evolves as you collect data. Developing research questions is an iterative process (University of Essex Online, 2025).

Also, a literature review critically evaluates sources to answer research questions and meet objectives. It involves comparing, contrasting, and discussing strengths and limitations. Literature is searched, assessed for relevance, and properly cited. It identifies relevant sources to inform data collection and potentially answer research questions. It highlights key ideas, strengths, limitations, and gaps in existing literature, ensuring relevance and value to the research project (University of Essex Online, 2025).

Sarantakos (2005) describes a literature review as a secondary analysis of existing information, placing the current study in its historical context. It involves finding various sources like reports, theses, journals, and databases (Saunders et al., 2012).

“...research questions turn a general purpose or aim into specific questions to which specific, data-driven, concrete, answers can be given” (Cohen et al., 2018)

![Lecturecast: Analysing research questions](/Modules/8/img/9.png)

![Lecturecast: Sections required for the Research Proposal](/Modules/8/img/11.png)

- **Figure 11**: Sections required for the Research Proposal (University of Essex Online, 2025)

Following on from the lecturecast we began a literature review for my chosen area of investigation.

#### Unit 3


In Week 3, we learned about research methods and how to plan a research project. 

They found out that researchers make certain assumptions about the world, knowledge, and personal values, which affect how they do research. 

Research design was explained as the plan for answering a research question. 

There were two main types: exploratory (to understand a problem better) and conclusive (to get clear answers). 

![Two Main Types Of Research](/Modules/8/img/12.png)

- **Figure 12**: Two Main Types Of Research (University of Essex Online, 2025)

Students also learned about three main research methods: qualitative (based on experiences), quantitative (based on numbers), and mixed methods (a mix of both). Data could be collected directly or from existing
 sources.
 
#### Unit 4

This unit introduced key qualitative data collection methods (case studies, focus groups, and observations), while also noting how some of these methods can be adapted for quantitative research. AN important point was that you may need to combine multiple methods to gather comprehensive data for your research.
 
 

| **Method**                | **Purpose**                                                                 | **Method Details**                                               | **Key Considerations**                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Case Studies**          | In depth exploration of individuals or groups to generate hypotheses.       | In depth research and study of individuals or groups.            | Not suitable for determining cause and effect. May suffer from researcher bias. Risk of weak generalizations due to atypical cases. Limited external validity. |
| **Focus Groups**          | Gather insights from a small, targeted group to answer “why,” “what,” “how”.| Group of people chosen to express their insights on the topic.   | Participants should share common backgrounds and experiences. Useful for understanding perceptions. Can also inform quantitative research.                    |
| **Quantitative Observation** | Collects numerical data (e.g., weight, volume, frequency).                  | Observing numerical values such as weight, volume, shape.        | Enables statistical analysis and objective measurement. Often involves surveys or experiments.                                                                |
| **Qualitative Observation** | Observes characteristics and behaviors in natural settings.                 | Monitoring of characteristics from a distance.                   | Respondents should be in a comfortable environment. Researcher may be a passive observer or an active participant.                                             |


#### Unit 5

In this unit we explored the foundational tools and techniques used in both qualitative and quantitative research, specifically focusing on interviews, surveys, and questionnaire design.
I now better understand the structure and purpose of questionnaires within surveys, and how to design effective questions. The unit also introduced pre- and post-testing techniques, methods to improve response rates, and basic strategies for analyzing collected data. Through lectures, readings, and practical activities, I developed the skills to select appropriate tools for their investigations and design data collection instruments aligned with their research goals.

### Module 8: Notes

#### Unit 1

##### Purpose of Research:

- Explore: Gain familiarity with a topic or situation.
- Describe: Detail your findings.
- Explain: Address the question "why?" (QuestionPro, 2021).

##### Research Approach:

- Follow the scientific method: Hypothesis formulation, reasoning, and testing, crucial for problem-solving (Andersen & Hepburn, 2020).

##### Types of Reasoning:

###### Deductive Reasoning:

- Idea → Observation → Conclusion.
- Example: "All men are mortal" → "Jason is a man" → "Jason is mortal."
- Moves from idea to observation.
- Perfect conclusions if assumptions are 100% correct.
- Harder to use outside lab settings due to lack of fully agreed-upon facts.

###### Inductive Reasoning:
- Observation → Analysis → Theory.
- Example: "I break out when I eat peanuts" → "Symptom of being allergic" → "I am allergic to peanuts."
- Moves from observation to idea.
- Useful for everyday problems with partial information.
- Practical but conclusions may not always be right.

##### Inference:

Both deduction and induction involve drawing conclusions based on evidence and reasoning.

##### Research Ethics:

- Crucial for all research, especially involving people.
- Ethical approval required before collecting data or conducting primary research.
- Applies to both qualitative (interviews, focus groups) and quantitative (experiments, questionnaires) research.
- Necessary for secondary data if it includes sensitive or personal information.
- Permission needed for non-freely accessible secondary data.
K
##### Key Principles of Research Ethics (Menlo Report):

**Respect**: Voluntary participation, consent, and anonymity.
**Beneficence**: Balance benefits and risks for participants.
**Justice**: Equal treatment and fair distribution of research benefits.
**Respect for Law and Public Interest**: Legal due diligence, accountability, integrity, quality, and transparency.
**Ethics vs. Morals**: Both concern 'right' and 'wrong' but differ in context.

Ethics in Computing ncludes additional considerations in the age of generative AI.

##### Professionalism:

- Essential in all research areas. BCS Code of Conduct provides guidance on professionalism, data protection, and intellectual property.
