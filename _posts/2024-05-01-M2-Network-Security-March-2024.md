## Module 2: Reflections

*Information about what I learnt during this module and how*

When taking on the module Network Security I was excited to learn more about the impact of cyber security on network systems and designs especially how the vulnerability assessment activities would contribute to this. At the same time, I was also a little apprehensive since networking is not something I had studied before and so was anticipating challenges around grasping the technical aspects involved in performing such assessments. Through this reflection, I aim to share the various experiences and knowledge gained by completing this module.

We began with applicable background reading used to research network security and vulnerabilities. Once completing this research, it become apparent that legal, social, ethical and professional elements must all be considered when protecting businesses participating in a digital economy. 
During collaborative discussion 1, Korateng (2024) highlighted that the integration of digital technologies brings unprecedented benefits but also comes with heightened cybersecurity risks. 

Temple-Raston (2021) further supported this when explaining how the SolarWinds hack highlighted the need to include your supply chain as a risk factor due to digital integrations. The SolarWinds hack was further discussed between students and the lecturer during the live seminars along with the paper by Hill, M. & Swinhoe, D. (2021) covering the 15 biggest data breaches of the 21st century. All agreed that the outcome of not protecting your digital enterprise can lead to significant ramifications. 

Equipped with a clear understanding of the need, the module content and activities turned to the possible methodologies for protecting a business by determining vulnerabilities and addressing them. After reading Temple-Raston, D. (2021) and McNab, C. (2017), it was a relief to discover simple to follow support on how to perform a vulnerability assessment was readily available. Alongside this, I also discovered tool sets were readily available to support such assessments too. Bhatt (2018) provided a good overview in a paper on how to use Kali Linux and its toolset for vulnerability assessments. These tools are easy to use even without prior experience. 

Further confidence came from the opportunity to practice this by scanning a provided target website, pchelpme.org.uk, following best practice models like STRIDE and OWASP Top 10. 

The results from initial practice scans were recorded on the module Wiki for other students to review and learn from.

Next, I attempted the first marked assignment where we were required to produce a Vulnerability Audit and Assessment - Baseline Analysis and Plan. This included devising a methodology for performing a full assessment along with the tools to use and why, as well as timings and potential impacts from doing so. Following the recommendations by McNab, C. (2017) was key to my ability to build such a methodology. Still nervous about how much I understood of what was covered to date, I was delighted to receive a distinction for this work.

We then proceeded to learn about the importance of cyber security logging and auditing. A paper by the SANS Institute (2010) helped in understanding what a successful SIEM and Log Management strategy could look like. Ekelhart. et al (2018) also helped explain the importance of a holistic logging solution via. a semantic approach that is balanced to the need of the business and that ensures log review is well covered and not just logging.

Next I attempted to complete the second marked assignment, to produce a Vulnerability Audit and Assessment - Results and Executive Summary. I found this task challenging but also rewarding. It provided me with the opportunity of carrying out my proposed methodology recorded in assignment 1. 
A key learning was how to pull together and synthesize findings, recommendations and conclusions in a clear and unambiguous format that would serve various stakeholder groups including executives. 

Reviewing and discussing the assessment template from PurpleSec, helped with framing up a template that could be populated, and applicable standards including GDPR considerations was included. The outcome of this work would be of real value to the website owner of the website assessed.

In conclusion this module has equipped me with a solid foundation in network security including the importance of protecting your network even though I began this module with little knowledge on networks. Importantly I also now know how using vulnerability assessments is a key part in securing a network or solution. I have a lot to learn still having only produced one vulnerability assessment report to date, but I am confident in my ability to help a business determine what cyber security threats they may be vulnerable to, and the importance of addressing them including remediation recommendations. I also now know such assessments must be replayed to continuously prepare for the ever-changing cyber risk landscape.
