## üß† Module 2: Reflections

*Information about what I learnt during this module and how*

---

When taking on the module **Network Security**, I was excited to learn more about the impact of cyber security on network systems and designs‚Äîespecially how the vulnerability assessment activities would contribute to this.

At the same time, I was also a little apprehensive since networking is not something I had studied before and so was anticipating challenges around grasping the technical aspects involved in performing such assessments. Through this reflection, I aim to share the various experiences and knowledge gained by completing this module.

---

We began with applicable background reading used to research network security and vulnerabilities. Once completing this research, it became apparent that **legal, social, ethical and professional elements** must all be considered when protecting businesses participating in a digital economy.

During **Collaborative Discussion 1**, *Korateng (2024)* highlighted that the integration of digital technologies brings unprecedented benefits but also comes with heightened cybersecurity risks.

*Temple-Raston (2021)* further supported this when explaining how the **SolarWinds hack** highlighted the need to include your supply chain as a risk factor due to digital integrations. The SolarWinds hack was further discussed between students and the lecturer during the live seminars, along with the paper by *Hill & Swinhoe (2021)* covering the 15 biggest data breaches of the 21st century. All agreed that the outcome of not protecting your digital enterprise can lead to significant ramifications.

Equipped with a clear understanding of the need, the module content and activities turned to the possible **methodologies for protecting a business** by determining vulnerabilities and addressing them.

After reading *Temple-Raston (2021)* and *McNab (2017)*, it was a relief to discover simple-to-follow guidance on how to perform a vulnerability assessment. Alongside this, I also discovered **tool sets were readily available** to support such assessments. *Bhatt (2018)* provided a good overview on using **Kali Linux** and its tools for vulnerability assessments‚Äîtools which are easy to use even without prior experience.

Further confidence came from the opportunity to **practice scanning a target website** (pchelpme.org.uk), following best practice models like **STRIDE** and **OWASP Top 10**.

The results from initial practice scans were recorded on the **module Wiki** for other students to review and learn from.

Next, I attempted the first marked assignment:  
üìù *Vulnerability Audit and Assessment ‚Äì Baseline Analysis and Plan*  
This included devising a methodology for performing a full assessment along with tools to use and why, as well as timings and potential impacts from doing so. Following *McNab (2017)* was key to my ability to build such a methodology. Still nervous about how much I understood, I was delighted to receive a **distinction** for this work.

---

We then proceeded to learn about the importance of **cyber security logging and auditing**.

- *SANS Institute (2010)* helped me understand what a successful SIEM and Log Management strategy could look like.
- *Ekelhart et al. (2018)* explained the importance of a **holistic semantic approach to logging**, balanced to business needs and ensuring log reviews‚Äînot just log collection.

---

Next, I completed the second marked assignment:  
üìù *Vulnerability Audit and Assessment ‚Äì Results and Executive Summary*  
This task was challenging but rewarding. It gave me the opportunity to **apply my proposed methodology** from assignment 1. A key learning was how to **synthesize findings, recommendations, and conclusions** into a clear and unambiguous format suitable for diverse stakeholders, including executives.

Reviewing the **assessment template from PurpleSec** helped with formatting, and I included applicable **standards and GDPR considerations**. The outcome would be of real value to the website owner of the assessed site.

### ‚úÖ In Conclusion

This module has equipped me with a **solid foundation in network security**, including the importance of protecting your network‚Äîeven though I began with little prior knowledge of networking.

I now understand that **vulnerability assessments are a key part** of securing a network or solution. While I have more to learn‚Äîhaving produced only one formal vulnerability assessment report‚ÄîI feel confident in helping a business determine its cybersecurity threats and how to address them.

Most importantly, I now appreciate that such assessments must be **repeated regularly** to prepare for the **ever-changing cyber risk landscape**.
