## 🗂️ e-Portfolio: Inappropriate Use of Survey Data – The Cambridge Analytica Scandal (2018)

Cambridge Analytica made the news in the United Kingdom and USA for gathering and sharing data from millions of Facebook users without their consent (**Confessore, 2018**). The data was obtained through what appeared to be innocuous surveys on Facebook in the guise of personality questionnaires. Although several users consented, the application accessed the data of their friends as well, without their knowledge or consent.

This was done to build psychological profiles for various uses including targeted political advertising during the 2016 US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.

> ⚠️ **Ethical & Legal Concerns:**  
> This approach was unethical as it misled participants about the true purpose behind the survey. It was also illegal as it violated both election laws and regulations on political advertising as well as EU regulations such as GDPR.

> 🌍 **Social & Professional Impact:**  
> The social impact included undermining the democratic process and public trust in polling. It also damaged the credibility of legitimate survey research.
