The reading provided research in architectural tranformations in Distributed Systems, alook at Cloud Computing, virtualisation, Storage and Networking as well as Security in distributed systems.

Summary of reading learning here 

We completed an individual formative exercise where we evaluated Alternative Operating Systems that helped build on operating system knowledge. I selected MS DOS.

[Individual Formative Exercise: Evaluating Alternative Operating Systems](/Modules/5/img/5.png)

- **Figure 4**: Individual Formative Exercise: Evaluating Alternative Operating Systems (University of Essex Online, 2024)

Finally, we also completed a unit 1 lecturecast that introduced to Secure Systems Architecture.

![Lecturecast: Introduction to Secure Systems Architecture](/Modules/5/img/4.png)

- **Figure 5**: Lecturecast: Introduction to Secure Systems Architecture (University of Essex Online, 2024)

We learnt the difference between distributed systems and operating systems, how to define the type and functions of a typical operating system, and some basic understandings of the design approaches of secure distributed systems.



####  Unit 2

Unit 2 introduced me to a number of modelling tools and languages including threat modelling and SysML. We got to build on our python skills during coding exercises implementing a distributed communication system.

![Module Unit 2 Modelling and Socket Programming](/Modules/5/img/6.png)

- **Figure 6**: Unit 2 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)


I learnt how to implement the sockets which support distributed computing using Python, with a client enabled in one process and a server enabled on the other.

![Module 5 Activity: Socket Programming](/Modules/5/img/13.png)

- **Figure 7**: Unit 2 Activity: Socket Programming (University of Essex Online, 2024)


During the seminar I also learnt about the AD modelling tool and how to use it for threat modelling techniques to model the threats to a system.

![Module Unit 2 ADTool](/Modules/5/img/12.png)

- **Figure 8**: Unit 2 ADTool (Kordy and Schweitzer, 2012)



#### Unit 3

Unit 3 introduced us to systems engineering and modelling techniques followed by our first assignment. 


![Module Unit 3 Systems Engineering and Modelling](/Modules/5/img/7.png)

- **Figure 9**: Unit 3 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)

The lecturecast taught me aspects of System Engineering. It explained the use of System modelling and describeb the different models available. I also learnt the differences between Distributed and Concurrent Systems

![Lecturecast: Systems Engineering and Modelling](/Modules/5/img/14.png)

- **Figure 10**: Lecturecast: Systems Engineering and Modelling (University of Essex Online, 2024)

The team assignment was challenging but fun. We had representation from across the globel including Africa, Middle East and Europe.

I took the lead in ramping the operating mechanisms up for the project, and suggested a number of proposals that the team agreed to including:
The use case to cover including the team contract, the use case to cover, the supporting tool to generate the ADt and the risk methodology.

- **Figure 11**: WhatsApp for team collaboration (University of Essex Online, 2024)

![WhatsApp for team collaboration](/Modules/5/img/28.png)

With all that in place we allocated portions of work across the team and set about getting it done in time.  

- **Figure 12**: Team media repository (University of Essex Online, 2024)

![Team media repository](/Modules/5/img/29.png)

This project work helped contributed to a number of proffesional development areas for myself, most notably time management and using digital platforms for remote teamwork and collaboration.the I learnt that ceratin countries have significant limitations on common collaboration tools by law, and that timezone considerations should include working days and holidays that are specific to countries I used these learning to update my Professional Skills matrix and action plan (PDP) with addtional actions that will help me further grow in these skill areas.


Finally we submitted our first assignment, a team project that required us to submit a proposed design report for a Attack-Defence Tree (AD) that models the activities associated with the networked devices in a Systems of Systems (SoS). 

- **Figure 13**: Assignment 1: Design Document (University of Essex Online, 2024)

![Assignment 1: Design Document](/Modules/5/img/30.png)

The project was fun, and our team worked well together to produce a quality submission, with excellent feedback including very positive input from my peers around my contribution.

#### Unit 4

Next, we took on a fundamental question: Is Cybersecurity a science? Here I learnt what is meant by ‚ÄòQuality of Service‚Äô when applied to distributed communications, and how to apply ‚ÄòThe Scientific Method‚Äô to Cybersecurity problems. The seminar was a key contributor to being able to answer this question.


![Module Unit 4 Modelling of Distributed Systems](/Modules/5/img/8.png)

- **Figure 15**: Unit 4 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)

We completed a collaborative Discussion on Solutions to the NSA/ Science of Security Hard Problems. This activity helped me identify and critically analyse operating system risks and issues, and identify appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to solve them.

![Module 5 Activity: Unit 4 Seminar Blog Post](/Modules/5/img/36.png)

- **Figure 16**: Unit 4 Seminar Blog Post (University of Essex Online, 2024)


#### Unit 5

During unit 5 we researched current and future challenges of Operating Systems and Distributed Systems.

![Module Unit 5 Current and Future Challenges of Operating Systems and Distributed Systems](/Modules/5/img/9.png)

- **Figure 17**: Unit 5 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)

During the lecturecast we also about future trends around Fog Computing, IoT and how they interoperate includings networking and operating systems standards and protocols commonly used.

![Lecturecast: Current and Future Challenges of Operating Systems and Distributed Systems](/Modules/5/img/32.png)

- **Figure 18**: Lecturecast: Current and Future Challenges of Operating Systems and Distributed Systems (University of Essex Online, 2024)

I came away from this unit wit han appreciatiation of the challenges of running secure operating and distributed systems in the modern world.


#### Unit 6

We then concluded the module by learning more about the challenges of assessing and assuring the security of distributed systems and processes.

![Module Unit 6 Formal Modelling vs. Automated Testing](/Modules/5/img/11.png)

- **Figure 19**: Unit 6 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)


The unit seminar was fun, we got to debate Formal Modelling vs. Automated Testing. Although I was unable to attend live due ot work committments, I was able to listen back using the recording. My peers shared some great perspectives on this.

Next we submitted our end of module assignment. This involved selecting a security problem, then designing and building a prototype system that investigated a selected problem, along with a analysis summary paper that discusse the question, model, experiments, analysis and the conclusion.


- **Figure 20**: Development Individual Project: Code Development (University of Essex Online, 2024)

![Application code](/Modules/5/img/37.png)

We then reflected on the learnings taken from the module, including looking at my final report (unit 6) vs. the proposal/design document (unit 3.
