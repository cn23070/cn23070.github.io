## Introduction

Hot off the completion of module 4: Secure Software Design, we moved onto the module Secure Software Architecture(SSA). This was another topic I started with minimal experiance at hand, and I was excited to learn more especially about distributed systems and operating systems including the role of virtualisation.

![Module Introduction](/Modules/5/img/1.png)

#### Unit 1

We began with an introduction to the concept of secure systems architectures, considered from the perspectives of operating systems and distributed systems, and their assocaitted security challenges.

![Module Unit 1 Introduction](/Modules/5/img/2.png)

- **Figure 2**: Unit 1 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)

The inital core reading provided research in architectural tranformations in Distributed Systems, a look at Cloud Computing, virtualisation, Storage and Networking, as well as Security in Distributed Systems.

The reading provided research in architectural tranformations in Distributed Systems, alook at Cloud Computing, virtualisation, Storage and Networking as well as Security in distributed systems.

Summary of reading learning here 

We completed an individual formative exercise where we evaluated Alternative Operating Systems that helped build on operating system knowledge. I selected MS DOS.

Finally, we also completed a unit 1 lecturecast that introduced to Secure Systems Architecture.

![Lecturecast: Introduction to Secure Systems Architecture](/Modules/5/img/4.png)

- **Figure 5**: Lecturecast: Introduction to Secure Systems Architecture (University of Essex Online, 2024)

We learnt the difference between distributed systems and operating systems, how to define the type and functions of a typical operating system, and some basic understandings of the design approaches of secure distributed systems.



####  Unit 2

Unit 2 introduced me to a number of modelling tools and languages including threat modelling and SysML. We got to build on our python skills during coding exercises implementing a distributed communication system.

![Module Unit 2 Modelling and Socket Programming](/Modules/5/img/6.png)

- **Figure 6**: Unit 2 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)


I learnt how to implement the sockets which support distributed computing using Python, with a client enabled in one process and a server enabled on the other.

![Module 5 Activity: Socket Programming](/Modules/5/img/13.png)

- **Figure x**: Unit 2 Activity: Socket Programming (University of Essex Online, 2024)


During the seminar I also learnt about the AD modelling tool and how to use it for threat modelling techniques to model the threats to a system.

#### Unit 3

Unit 3 introduced us to systems engineering and modelling techniques followed by our first assignment. 


![Module Unit 3 Systems Engineering and Modelling](/Modules/5/img/7.png)

- **Figure 7**: Unit 3 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)

The lecturecast taught me aspects of System Engineering. It explained the use of System modelling and describeb the different models available. I also learnt the differences between Distributed and Concurrent Systems

![Lecturecast: Systems Engineering and Modelling](/Modules/5/img/14.png)

- **Figure 5**: Lecturecast: Systems Engineering and Modelling (University of Essex Online, 2024)

The team assignment was challenging but fun. We had representation from across the globel including Africa, Middle East and Europe.

I took the lead in ramping the operating mechanisms up for the project, and suggested a number of proposals that the team agreed to including:
The use case to cover including the team contract, the use case to cover, the supporting tool to generate the ADt and the risk methodology.

With all that in place we allocated portions of work across the team and set about getting it done in time.

![Team media repository](/Modules/5/img/29.png)

This project work helped contributed to a number of proffesional development areas for myself, most notably time management and using digital platforms for remote teamwork and collaboration.the I learnt that ceratin countries have significant limitations on common collaboration tools by law, and that timezone considerations should include working days and holidays that are specific to countries I used these learning to update my Professional Skills matrix and action plan (PDP) with addtional actions that will help me further grow in these skill areas.


Finally we submitted our first assignment, a team project that required us to submit a proposed design report for a Attack-Defence Tree (AD) that models the activities associated with the networked devices in a Systems of Systems (SoS). 

- **Figure 10**: Assignment 1: Design Document (University of Essex Online, 2024)

![Assignment 1: Design Document](/Modules/5/img/30.png)

The project was fun, and our team worked well together to produce a quality submission, with excellent feedback including very positive input from my peers around my contribution.

#### Unit 4

Next, we took on a fundamental question: Is Cybersecurity a science? Here I learnt what is meant by ‘Quality of Service’ when applied to distributed communications, and how to apply ‘The Scientific Method’ to Cybersecurity problems. The seminar was a key contributor to being able to answer this question.


![Module Unit 4 Modelling of Distributed Systems](/Modules/5/img/8.png)

- **Figure 12**: Unit 4 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)

We completed a collaborative Discussion on Solutions to the NSA/ Science of Security Hard Problems. This activity helped me identify and critically analyse operating system risks and issues, and identify appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to solve them.

#### Unit 5

During unit 5 we researched current and future challenges of Operating Systems and Distributed Systems.

![Module Unit 5 Current and Future Challenges of Operating Systems and Distributed Systems](/Modules/5/img/9.png)

- **Figure 14**: Unit 5 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)

During the lecturecast we also about future trends around Fog Computing, IoT and how they interoperate includings networking and operating systems standards and protocols commonly used.

![Lecturecast: Current and Future Challenges of Operating Systems and Distributed Systems](/Modules/5/img/32.png)

- **Figure 15**: Lecturecast: Current and Future Challenges of Operating Systems and Distributed Systems (University of Essex Online, 2024)

I came away from this unit wit han appreciatiation of the challenges of running secure operating and distributed systems in the modern world.


#### Unit 6

We then concluded the module by learning more about the challenges of assessing and assuring the security of distributed systems and processes.

![Module Unit 6 Formal Modelling vs. Automated Testing](/Modules/5/img/11.png)

- **Figure 16**: Unit 6 Homepage (University of Essex Online, 2024)


The unit seminar was fun, we got to debate Formal Modelling vs. Automated Testing. Although I was unable to attend live due ot work committments, I was able to listen back using the recording. My peers shared some great perspectives on this.

Next we submitted our end of module assignment. This involved selecting a security problem, then designing and building a prototype system that investigated a selected problem, along with a analysis summary paper that discusse the question, model, experiments, analysis and the conclusion.

![README File](/Modules/5/img/xx.png)

We then reflected on the learnings taken from the module, including looking at my final report (unit 6) vs. the proposal/design document (unit 3.

#### Conclusion

Building on my learnings on how to code and test an application using Python was fun, challenging and insightful. The feedback from my peers was positive, constructive and actionable. I plan to take my further experiance of development and testing prototypes using python into my current cyber work activities.
