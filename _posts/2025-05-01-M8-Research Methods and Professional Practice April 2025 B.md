## Module 8: Reflections

*Information about what I learnt during this module and how*

#### Unit 1

In the first week, we were introduced to Research Methods as a subject, beginning with an overview of the Scientific Method and ethical considerations in research.

Some key take aways include addressing the following questions:

what is the Purpose of Research? To explore (gain familiarity with a topic or situation), to describe (detail your findings), and to explain (address the question "why?") (QuestionPro, 2021).
