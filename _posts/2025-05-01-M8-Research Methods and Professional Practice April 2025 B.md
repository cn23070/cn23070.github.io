### e-Portfolio Activity: Reflective Activity 1 – Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI

Corrêa et al. (2023) conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 200 governance policies and ethical guidelines for AI usage published by various entities worldwide, including public bodies, academic institutions, private companies, and civil society organizations. The study aimed to identify common principles and areas of consensus that could inform future regulatory efforts. The authors found 17 prevalent principles, such as transparency, accountability, privacy, and fairness, which are crucial for ethical AI governance.

#### Discussion on Global Approaches to AI Governance
Different countries have adopted varied approaches to AI governance, reflecting their unique legal, social, and cultural contexts. For instance, the European Union approach to AI focuses on  excellence and trust, aiming to boost research and industrial capacity while ensuring safety and fundamental rights European Commission, 2025). It has been proactive in establishing comprehensive AI regulations, emphasizing human rights and ethical considerations. In contrast, the United States has taken a more decentralized approach, with guidelines and recommendations emerging from various federal agencies and industry groups. The focus in the U.S. has been on promoting innovation while addressing ethical concerns through voluntary frameworks and industry standards
The RAND Corporation paper compares U.S. and Chinese AI governance approaches, noting key differences in domestic regulation focus, principles, and international governance implementation (RAND Corporation, 2023).

#### Personal Views and Recommendations
Given the diverse approaches to AI governance, I believe a focus on areas of consesus should be priortised, whilst in parallel areas of contetion worked through with the aim of better allignment. Risk should be leveraged in order to determine objective and agreed areas to further advance globally, and existing international organisations and their functions such as the UNited Nations and World Health Organisation should be leveraged to facilaite this work. This view is supported by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Artificial Intelligence (2024), who states that AI governance within the UN system should focus on ethical considerations, international cooperation, and leveraging existing normative frameworks.

#### Justification from Literature

The work by Corrêa et al. (2023) provides an oppurtuntiy for the international community to focus on common principles and areas of consensus that could inform future regulatory efforts.

Both the OECD AI Principles and he Deloitte AI Governance Roadmap (2024) further support this by also highlighting and promoting a number of the same common AI priciples including transparency and explainability, security and reliability, as well as fairness and privacy. 


#### Impact on Legal, Social, and Professional Issues
Implementing a balanced AI governance strategy would have several implications:

##### Legal Issues
Compliance: Ensuring AI systems comply with existing laws and regulations, such as data protection and anti-discrimination laws.
Liability: Clarifying liability for AI-related harms, which is crucial for accountability and trust.

##### Social Issues
Equity: Promoting fairness and reducing biases in AI systems to prevent discrimination and ensure equitable access to AI benefits.
Public Trust: Building public trust in AI through transparency and accountability measures.

##### Professional Issues
Ethical Standards: Establishing clear ethical standards for AI professionals to guide responsible AI development and deployment.
Skill Development: Investing in education and training for AI professionals to ensure they are equipped to handle 
ethical and governance challenges.


#### Conclusion
In conclusion, a balanced approach to AI governance that combines regulatory oversight with industry self-regulation is essential for addressing the ethical, legal, social, and professional challenges posed by AI. By drawing on the principles identified by Corrêa et al. (2023) and other relevant literature, we can develop robust governance frameworks that promote responsible AI use while fostering innovation.

## Module 8: Reflections

*Information about what I learnt during this module and how*

#### Unit 1

![Module Introduction](/Modules/8/img/1.png)

- **Figure 1**: Module Introduction (University of Essex Online, 2024)

In the first week of our unit on Research Methods, we explored the Scientific Method and ethical considerations in research. Key takeaways included understanding the purpose of research (explore, describe, explain (QuestionPro, 2021)), the importance of the scientific method for problem-solving (Andersen & Hepburn, 2020), and the two core types of reasoning: deductive and inductive (Miessler, D, 2018). 

![The Difference Between Deductive and Inductive Reasoning](/Modules/8/img/2.png)

- **Figure 2**: The Difference Between Deductive and Inductive Reasoning (Miessler, D, 2018)

Deductive reasoning moves from an idea to an observation, while inductive reasoning goes from an observation to an idea. Both are forms of inference, drawing conclusions based on evidence and reasoning. We also emphasized the importance of research ethics, requiring ethical approval before data collection, and highlighted key principles as described in the Menlo Report(2023) such as respect, beneficence, justice, and respect for law and public interest. 

Additionally, we learnt the significance of professionalism and ethics in computing.

"Ethical issues in computer science and information systems projects occur in three areas – how the research is performed, how you deal with participants and how you present your results." (Dawson, C, 2015) 

Key considerations include integrity, competence, and committment to public interest (British Computer Society (BCS), n.d.), especially in the age of generative AI.

### Module 8: Notes

#### Unit 1

##### Purpose of Research:

- Explore: Gain familiarity with a topic or situation.
- Describe: Detail your findings.
- Explain: Address the question "why?" (QuestionPro, 2021).

##### Research Approach:

- Follow the scientific method: Hypothesis formulation, reasoning, and testing, crucial for problem-solving (Andersen & Hepburn, 2020).

##### Types of Reasoning:

###### Deductive Reasoning:

- Idea → Observation → Conclusion.
- Example: "All men are mortal" → "Jason is a man" → "Jason is mortal."
- Moves from idea to observation.
- Perfect conclusions if assumptions are 100% correct.
- Harder to use outside lab settings due to lack of fully agreed-upon facts.

###### Inductive Reasoning:
- Observation → Analysis → Theory.
- Example: "I break out when I eat peanuts" → "Symptom of being allergic" → "I am allergic to peanuts."
- Moves from observation to idea.
- Useful for everyday problems with partial information.
- Practical but conclusions may not always be right.

##### Inference:

Both deduction and induction involve drawing conclusions based on evidence and reasoning.

##### Research Ethics:

- Crucial for all research, especially involving people.
- Ethical approval required before collecting data or conducting primary research.
- Applies to both qualitative (interviews, focus groups) and quantitative (experiments, questionnaires) research.
- Necessary for secondary data if it includes sensitive or personal information.
- Permission needed for non-freely accessible secondary data.
K
##### Key Principles of Research Ethics (Menlo Report):

**Respect**: Voluntary participation, consent, and anonymity.
**Beneficence**: Balance benefits and risks for participants.
**Justice**: Equal treatment and fair distribution of research benefits.
**Respect for Law and Public Interest**: Legal due diligence, accountability, integrity, quality, and transparency.
**Ethics vs. Morals**: Both concern 'right' and 'wrong' but differ in context.

Ethics in Computing ncludes additional considerations in the age of generative AI.

##### Professionalism:

- Essential in all research areas. BCS Code of Conduct provides guidance on professionalism, data protection, and intellectual property.
