## Module 8: Reflections

*Information about what I learnt during this module and how*

#### Unit 1

![Module Introduction](/Modules/8/img/1.png)

- **Figure 1**: Module Introduction (University of Essex Online, 2024)

In the first week of our unit on Research Methods, we explored the Scientific Method and ethical considerations in research. Key takeaways included understanding the purpose of research (explore, describe, explain (QuestionPro, 2021)), the importance of the scientific method for problem-solving (Andersen & Hepburn, 2020), and the two core types of reasoning: deductive and inductive (Miessler, D, 2018). 

![The Difference Between Deductive and Inductive Reasoning](/Modules/8/img/2.png)

- **Figure 2**: The Difference Between Deductive and Inductive Reasoning (Miessler, D, 2018)

Deductive reasoning moves from an idea to an observation, while inductive reasoning goes from an observation to an idea. Both are forms of inference, drawing conclusions based on evidence and reasoning. We also emphasized the importance of research ethics, requiring ethical approval before data collection, and highlighted key principles as described in the Menlo Report(2023) such as respect, beneficence, justice, and respect for law and public interest. 

Additionally, we learnt the significance of professionalism and ethics in computing.

"Ethical issues in computer science and information systems projects occur in three areas ‚Äì how the research is performed, how you deal with participants and how you present your results." (Dawson, C, 2015) 

Key considerations include integrity, competence, and committment to public interest (British Computer Society (BCS), n.d.), especially in the age of generative AI.

### Module 8: Notes

#### Unit 1

##### Purpose of Research:

- Explore: Gain familiarity with a topic or situation.
- Describe: Detail your findings.
- Explain: Address the question "why?" (QuestionPro, 2021).

##### Research Approach:

- Follow the scientific method: Hypothesis formulation, reasoning, and testing, crucial for problem-solving (Andersen & Hepburn, 2020).

##### Types of Reasoning:

###### Deductive Reasoning:

- Idea ‚Üí Observation ‚Üí Conclusion.
- Example: "All men are mortal" ‚Üí "Jason is a man" ‚Üí "Jason is mortal."
- Moves from idea to observation.
- Perfect conclusions if assumptions are 100% correct.
- Harder to use outside lab settings due to lack of fully agreed-upon facts.

###### Inductive Reasoning:
- Observation ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Theory.
- Example: "I break out when I eat peanuts" ‚Üí "Symptom of being allergic" ‚Üí "I am allergic to peanuts."
- Moves from observation to idea.
- Useful for everyday problems with partial information.
- Practical but conclusions may not always be right.

##### Inference:

Both deduction and induction involve drawing conclusions based on evidence and reasoning.

##### Research Ethics:

- Crucial for all research, especially involving people.
- Ethical approval required before collecting data or conducting primary research.
- Applies to both qualitative (interviews, focus groups) and quantitative (experiments, questionnaires) research.
- Necessary for secondary data if it includes sensitive or personal information.
- Permission needed for non-freely accessible secondary data.
K
##### Key Principles of Research Ethics (Menlo Report):

**Respect**: Voluntary participation, consent, and anonymity.
**Beneficence**: Balance benefits and risks for participants.
**Justice**: Equal treatment and fair distribution of research benefits.
**Respect for Law and Public Interest**: Legal due diligence, accountability, integrity, quality, and transparency.
**Ethics vs. Morals**: Both concern 'right' and 'wrong' but differ in context.

Ethics in Computing ncludes additional considerations in the age of generative AI.

##### Professionalism:

- Essential in all research areas. BCS Code of Conduct provides guidance on professionalism, data protection, and intellectual property.
