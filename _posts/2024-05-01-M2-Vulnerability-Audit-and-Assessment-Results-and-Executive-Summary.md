# üõ°Ô∏è Vulnerability Audit and Assessment - Results and Executive Summary



## üõ°Ô∏è Scope and objective



This report outlines the scope, work done, testing results, and recommendations to address the findings identified during the vulnerability assessment for the website .



provides online ticketing services and is based on HESK Help Desk legacy software version: 3.2.5.(latest is 3.4.5). The underlying makeup of the platform includes PHP 8.0.30, MySQL 8.0.13, TinyMCE 5.10.2 and HTMLPurifier 4.14.0.



## üõ°Ô∏è Executive summary

As per industry best practice it is suggested to follow the recommendations.





## üõ°Ô∏è Recommendations



Table 1 Recommendations

| Proposed Control | Remediation Area &Findings Count | Rationale for Inclusion | Implementation Guidance |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vulnerability Management | A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components (18) | Protect against known exploitations and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. | Regularly scan for vulnerabilities and apply patches promptly to mitigate potential risks. |
| Secure Coding Practices | A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components (18) | Code review should involve reviewing system source code by a competent reviewer to detect vulnerabilities and defects (Viegas et al., 2022). | Implement secure coding practices like threat modelling, code reviews and testing into the SDLC. |
| Data Encryption in transit | A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration (10) | SSL/TLS supports bi-directional encryption and authentication, helping protect data transfer from eavesdropping and manipulation (Anderson, 2020). | Use encryption protocols like TLS, SFTP or HTTPS to secure data transmission. (LeBlanc & Howard, 2002). |
| Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) | A01:2021-Broken Access Control (2) | MFA requires two or more independent authentication factors, ensuring a more rigorous authentication process. (Fanti, 2023). | Implement MFA for both Customer and Employee authentication |
| Access Controls | A01:2021-Broken Access Control (2) | Anderson (2020) argues the main function of access control is to prevent the harm that can be done by users, and programs whether through error or malice. | Implement access controls that limit user privileges and restrict access to sensitive data and critical systems following the principle of least privileged. |
| Security Training and Awareness | All areas | Frequent security training is required due to changes in the security landscape (LeBlanc & Howard, 2002). | Train employees on the importance of data security, privacy, and compliance. |

Addressing the data privacy areas over and above implementing the recommended cyber security controls will create a secure and trustworthy online ticketing system while helping ensure compliance with data protection laws and regulations. Requirements to consider are below and are based on the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).



Data Privacy Considerations



Table 2 GDPR Considerations

| GDPR Data Protection Principles (Wolford, 2022) | Requirement Information (Wolford, 2022) | Proposed Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency | Processing must be legal and just, and transparent to the data subject. | Maintain a privacy policy that is accessible to all relevant stakeholders. (LeBlanc & Howard, 2002). |
| Purpose limitation | Process data for valid purposes, clearly communicated to the data subject when you collected it | Maintain a data retention policy that includes data retention and deletion requirements. |
| Storage limitation | Only store personally identifying data for as long as necessary for the specified purpose. | Maintain a data retention policy that includes data retention and deletion requirements. |
| Data minimization | Collect and process only the minimum essential data necessary for the purposes specified. | Only collect the minimum data required. Enable audit logging. (LeBlanc & Howard, 2002). |
| Accuracy | Keep personal data accurate and current. | Implement procedures for regular evaluation of the accuracy of customer and employee data. |
| Integrity and confidentiality | Processing must be done securely to ensure appropriate integrity, and confidentiality of data. | Encrypt sensitive data using a good cryptographic algorithm and well-protected key. (LeBlanc & Howard, 2002). |
| Accountability | The data controller must be able to demonstrate GDPR compliance with all these principles. | Perform regular privacy audits that seek out evidence to conformance. |

## üõ°Ô∏è Limitations



Network vulnerability scanning was limited to prevent impact to the live hosting service. Whilst best efforts have been taken when generating these results, there can be no assurance that all possible vulnerabilities have been identified or that recommendations will fully address them.





## üõ°Ô∏è Assessment methodology



Table 3 Methodology Followed

| Methodology | Objective | Tools | Tool rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stage 1 Reconnaissance | Identify networks, hosts, and users of interest. | Web search engines | Publicly available visibly of the company and assets |
| Stage 1 Reconnaissance | Identify networks, hosts, and users of interest. | WHOIS databases | Query the Internet registrar databases. |
| Stage 1 Reconnaissance | Identify networks, hosts, and users of interest. | NETSTAT | Determine unauthorised connections, listening ports, and to analyse for suspicious network activity |
| Stage 1 Reconnaissance | Identify networks, hosts, and users of interest. | NSLookup | Query the DNS (domain name server) systemin order to translate URL (uniform resource locator) into IP addresses. |
| Stage 2 Vulnerability Scanning | Bulk scan for accessible network services that can be exploited | Nmap Legion | Report on services running on the host of the site or application in question. |
| Stage 2 Vulnerability Scanning | Bulk scan for accessible network services that can be exploited | Nmap Legion | Report on services running on the host of the site or application in question. |
| Stage 3 Investigation of Vulnerabilities | Identify and investigate known vulnerabilities in detail using public and private vulnerability sources | Nikto  NIST National Vulnerability Database  CERT Vulnerability Notes | Determine known vulnerabilities and their criticality for the mapped target environment |





## üõ°Ô∏è Findings



Vulnerabilities listed in this report were found using both automatic tool detection and manual testing detailed in Table 3. The priority is based off the Common Vulnerability Scoring System. CVSS provides an open framework for communicating impacts of IT vulnerabilities (Mell et al., 2007).
