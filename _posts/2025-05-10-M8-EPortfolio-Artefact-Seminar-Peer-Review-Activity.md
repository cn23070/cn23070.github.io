## 🎓 Reflective Activity 2 – Unit 3 Seminar: Peer Review Activity

### ✍️ *Provide a summary overview of two papers selected*

| 📄 **Paper** | **Title** | **Summary** |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Paper 1** | *Blockchain and Lightweight Deep Learning-Based DDoS Mitigation Framework for H-IoT Security* <br> ElSayed et al. (2025a) | Presents a decentralised security framework (combination of blockchain technology and lightweight deep learning model) designed to protect Healthcare IoT systems from DDoS attacks. |
| **Paper 2** | *Security and Privacy Threats in H-IoT: A Comprehensive Taxonomy, Challenges, and Future Directions* <br> Alzahrani et al. (2024) | Provides a detailed and comprehensive taxonomy of security and privacy threats in healthcare IoT. |

### 🎯 *Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research question of each paper*

| 📘 **Paper** | **Research Question** | **Contribution** |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Paper 1** | How can a decentralized framework combining blockchain and lightweight deep learning be designed to effectively detect and mitigate DDoS attacks in Healthcare IoT (H-IoT) environments while preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead? | Contributes with technical innovation, privacy by design, lightweight and scalable solution that can be expanded outside of just DDoS. |
| **Paper 2** | What are the key security and privacy threats in Healthcare IoT systems, and how can these be systematically categorized to identify current challenges and guide future research directions? | Contributes with structured classifications of modern day security and privacy threats and highlights key IoT challenges around technical, regulatory and privacy. |

### 🧪 *Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the stated purpose or question?*

| 🧠 **Paper** | **Methodology** | **Appropriateness** |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Paper 1** | Design Science and Experimental Evaluation | ✅ Yes – well suited to solution-focused research. Validated through simulation-based experiments. Quantitative experiments allow for objective evaluation of system effectiveness and overhead—critical in assessing suitability for real-world H-IoT use. <br> *Scope is limited to DDoS.* |
| **Paper 2** | Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and Taxonomical Analysis | ✅ Yes – ideal for addressing exploratory questions and providing a theoretical and conceptual framework for future research and technology development. <br> *Does lack empirical data.* |

---

### 📊 *In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or question?*

| 📂 **Paper** | **Data Collection & Analysis** |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **Paper 1** | ✔️ Yes – system was evaluated using real-world datasets (e.g., CICIDS2017, CICDoS2016) and machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest) to assess detection accuracy and performance. |
| **Paper 2** | ✔️ Yes – although lacking empirical data, the aim is not to validate a solution but to synthesize existing knowledge. |

---

### 🔍 *Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?*

| ✅ **Paper** | **Support for Claims** |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Paper 1** | ✔️ Yes – with measurable evidence such as simulation results. |
| **Paper 2** | ✔️ Yes – provides a rigorous and systematic basis for all its claims, grounded in existing research. |

---

### 💡 *How would you enhance the work/paper?*

| 🛠️ **Paper** | **Enhancement Suggestions** |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| **Paper 1** | Increase scope of threat coverage. |
| **Paper 2** | Incorporate case studies, incident reports, or survey data. |
