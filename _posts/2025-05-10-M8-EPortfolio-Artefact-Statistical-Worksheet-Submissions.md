## üìä Unit 6/7 ‚Äì Summary Measures

### **Exercise 6.1 ‚Äì Descriptive Statistics and Data Exploration**

![Exercise 6.1](/Modules/8/img/19.png)

- **Figure 1**: Exercise 6.1 (University of Essex Online, 2025)

- **Diet A (n = 50):**
  - Mean weight loss: **5.341 kg**
  - SD: **2.536 kg**
  - Median: **5.642 kg**
  - IQR: **3.451 kg**
- **Diet B (n = 50):**
  - Mean weight loss: **3.710 kg**
  - SD: **2.769 kg**

**Interpretation:**  
Both diets led to weight loss, but **Diet A was more effective** overall, with higher mean, median, and lower variability. Most individuals experienced positive results.

### **Exercise 6.2 ‚Äì Frequency Distributions**
Explored weight loss and brand preferences using frequency tables and bar charts.

### **Exercise 6.3 ‚Äì Comparative Analysis of Distributions**

![Exercise 6.3](/Modules/8/img/21.png)

- **Figure 3**: Exercise 6.3 (University of Essex Online, 2025)

- **Area 1 (n = 70):**
  - Brand A: 15.7%, Brand B: 24.3%, Other: 60%
- **Area 2 (n = 90):**
  - Brand A: 21%, Brand B: 33%, Other: 46%

**Interpretation:**  
‚ÄúOther‚Äù was the most preferred brand in both areas. **Brand B** consistently outperformed Brand A by ~10%.

- **Figure 4**: Exercise 7.1 (University of Essex Online, 2025)

- **Test:** One-tailed paired t-test
- **Conclusion:** Filter Agent 1 is more effective (p = 0.0092)

### **Exercise 7.2 ‚Äì Income Comparison by Gender**

![Exercise 7.2](/Modules/8/img/23.png)

- **Figure 5**: Exercise 7.2 (University of Essex Online, 2025)

- **Conclusion:** Male cardholders have significantly higher income (p = 0.0007)

### **Exercise 7.3 ‚Äì Comparison of Filtration Agents**

![Exercise 7.3](/Modules/8/img/24.png)

- **Figure 6**: Exercise 7.3 (University of Essex Online, 2025)

- **Test:** Two-tailed paired t-test
- **Conclusion:** Significant difference found; Agent 2 likely more effective (p ‚âà 0.018)

### **Exercise 7.4 ‚Äì Filter Agent Comparison**

![Exercise 7.4](/Modules/8/img/25.png)

- **Figure 7**: Exercise 7.4 (University of Essex Online, 2025)

- **Test:** One-tailed paired t-test
- **Conclusion:** Agent 1 outperformed Agent 2 in impurity reduction (p = 0.00377)

### **Exercise 7.5 ‚Äì Gender and Income Comparison**

![Exercise 7.5](/Modules/8/img/26.png)

- **Figure 8**: Exercise 7.5 (University of Essex Online, 2025)

- **Test:** One-tailed independent t-test
- **Conclusion:** Strong evidence of income disparity favoring males (p = 0.0007)

## üìä Unit 8/9 ‚Äì Graphical Analysis

### **Exercise 9.1 ‚Äì Brand Preference by Area**

![Exercise 9.1](/Modules/8/img/27.png)

- **Figure 9**: Exercise 9.1 (University of Essex Online, 2025)

- **Area 1:** 60% chose ‚ÄúOther‚Äù
- **Area 2:** Over 54% chose Brand A or B
- **Conclusion:** Area 2 shows stronger brand loyalty

### **Exercise 9.2 & 9.5 ‚Äì Clustered Column Bar Charts**
- Constructed for visualizing percentage brand preferences by area and demographics

![Exercise 9.2](/Modules/8/img/28.png)

- **Figure 10**: Exercise 9.2 (University of Essex Online, 2025)


![Exercise 9.5](/Modules/8/img/31.png)

- **Figure 11**: Exercise 9.5 (University of Essex Online, 2025)


### **Exercise 9.3 ‚Äì Weight Loss for Diet A**

![Exercise 9.3](/Modules/8/img/29.png)

- **Figure 12**: Exercise 9.3 (University of Essex Online, 2025)

- Bell-shaped, symmetrical histogram centered at **5.3 kg**
- **Conclusion:** Diet A offers consistent, moderate weight loss

### **Exercise 9.4 ‚Äì Brand Preference Repeated**

![Exercise 9.4](/Modules/8/img/30.png)

- **Figure 13**: Exercise 9.4 (University of Essex Online, 2025)

- Confirmed previous result: Area 2 prefers named brands more than Area 1

### **Exercise 9.6 ‚Äì Weight Loss for Diet B**

![Exercise 9.4](/Modules/8/img/32.png)

- **Figure 14**: Exercise 9.6 (University of Essex Online, 2025)

- Right-skewed histogram
- **Conclusion:** Diet B yields more variable and generally lower weight loss than Diet A

## ‚úÖ Feedback

The charts and interpretations provided align well with the task objectives and show a clear understanding of the data analysis techniques.
 
Some suggestions for improvement are below:
 
- Exercise 9.1 & 9.4: You could strengthen your analysis by hypothesizing why Area 2 has more brand loyalty‚Äîe.g., economic differences, urban vs. rural.
- Exercise 9.2 & 9.5: Consider labeling the values on each bar (data labels) for clarity, especially if readers are reviewing without spreadsheet context.
- Exercise 9.3 & 9.6: For critical evaluation, consider discussing outliers or potential reasons for variability in Diet B (e.g., adherence levels, starting weight, or other confounding factors).
