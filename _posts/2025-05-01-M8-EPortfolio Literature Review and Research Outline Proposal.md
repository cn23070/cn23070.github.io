## Project Title: Module 8 Literature Review Proposed Outline for Topic: Cybersecurity Threats in IoT in the Healthcare Sector

#### Introduction (Approx. 250 words)

- Aim of the review 
- Significance to the research problem

- Overview of IoT in healthcare sector
- Importance of cybersecurity and protection of patient data in healthcare IoT

#### Context, Perspective, and Theoretical Framework (Approx. 200 words)

- Context 

*Research Question*

- security risk management perspective covering multi layer nature of h-IoT (physical, connectivty, application)
- What are the most prevelant cyber threats targeting healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) systems, and how can these threats be best mitigated using current threat intelligence and vulnerability data?
- *Frameworks:*
- STRIDE model to categorize threats.
- MITRE ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain to assess threat behaviors and mitigation tactics.
- CyBOK framework to map findings to recognized domains of cybersecurity knowledge.

#### Methodology (Approx. 200 words)

*Conduct a comprehensive systematic literature review*

- Databases: IEEE Xplore, Scopus, PubMed, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, PubMed Central, SpringerLink, Google Scholar.
- Inclusion criteria: Peer-reviewed publications (2018–2025), peer reviewed papers, in english, focusing on healthcare IoT threats, vulnerabilities and defences 
- Search strategy: “Healthcare IoT cyber threats,” “H-IoT vulnerabilities,” “medical IoT security,” “threat intelligence healthcare,” “CVE medical devices,” "Healthcare IoT" or "H-IoT" and "cyber threats" and "attack vectors" or "vulnerabilities" or "security risks" and "mitigation" or "cybersecurity countermeasures" etc.
- Exclusion criteria include studies not related to healthcare, papers focusing only on general IoT and not healthcare IoT, articles with insufficient technical detail on threats and countermeasures

*Data Extraction and Synthesis*

- Threat Intelligence and Vulnerability Data Analysis
- Structured data extracted from reputable threat intelligence sources, including MITRE ATT&CK for ICS/IoT, Nist National Vulnerability Database (NVD), Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) records, and CISA Healthcare Cybersecurity Bulletins.
- Threat instances will be classified by: Type, Impact, Affected device and / or system, Mitigation
- Data will be organised into a Threat / Mitigation Table, which will form a key project artifact.


#### Review of Literature (Approx. 800 words)

*Types of Cybersecurity Threats*
	
- Malware: prevalence and impact in healthcare IoT
- Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: prevalence and impact in healthcare IoT
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: prevalence and impact in healthcare IoT
- Other Attacks: prevalence and impact in healthcare IoT

*Vulnerabilities in IoT Devices*

- Device Security Flaws: Studies covering common security flaws in IoT devices
- Network Security Issues: Studies covering common network security flaws relevant to IoT Healthcare devices
	

*Impact on Healthcare*

- Patient Safety: Impact analysis from cyber threats
- Operational / Regulatory / Other: Studies covering impacts caused by cyberattacks on IoT devices
- Financial Implications: Financial impact analysis covering cybersecurity data breeches in Healthcare


*Mitigation Strategies*

- Studies on impact of relevant cybersecurity technical countermeasures to address the threats and vulnerabilities
- Overview of regulations covering IoT in Healthcare and their impact
- Studies covering best practice for securing IoT devices in Healthcare
- Studies covering emerging technologies that may potentially enhance the security IoT devices in Healthcare

#### Critical Evaluation (Approx. 400 words)


#### Conclusion and Future Directions (Approx. 150 words)
