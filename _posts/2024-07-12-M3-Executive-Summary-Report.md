# ðŸ“Š Executive Summary: Pampered Pets Risk Evaluation

---



# ðŸ“˜ Introduction

This report evaluates the potential product quality and availability risks associated with the digitisation and internationalisation of the Pampered Pets business including the introduction of an international supply chain and automated warehouses worldwide. Additionally, it outlines a business continuity / disaster recovery strategy to help ensure a 24/7 digital e-commerce customer service capability.



# ðŸ“˜ Risk Methodology

ISO 31000 was used as the overarching risk assessment methodology. ISO 31000 is a well adopted and comprehensive framework with international recognition (Olechowski et al. ,2016).

Figure 1 Risk Management Process based on ISO 31000











Firstly, the business context was established.

![Figure 9](/Modules/3/img/image_9.png)





Next Risk analysis was carried out, and risks scored according to impact and likelihood (Impact + Likelihood = Risk).



|  |  | Likelihood | Likelihood | Likelihood | Likelihood | Likelihood |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  | Never | Very Low | Low | Moderate | High |
| Business Impact | Catastrophic | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
| Business Impact | Critical | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| Business Impact | Serious | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| Business Impact | Significant | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| Business Impact | Minor | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |



Table 1 Risk Scoring Matrix



| Risk | Risk Score |
|---|---|
| High | 7 â€“ 10 |
| Medium | 5 â€“ 7 |
| Low | 2 - 4 |



Table 2 Risk Scoring Matrix Continued



To score business impact a qualitative impact matrix based on ISO 27005:2022 was used as it is a simple and well-established.



| Consequences | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 â€“ Minor | Negligible consequences for the organization  No consequences on operations or the performance of the activity or on the safety of persons and property.   The organization will overcome the situation without too much difficulty (margins will be consumed). |
| 2 â€“ Significant | Significant but limited consequences for the organization  Degradation in the performance of the activity with no consequences on the safety of persons and property.   The organization will overcome the situation despite a few difficulties (operation in degraded mode). |
| â€“ Serious | Substantial consequences for the organization  High degradation in the performance of the activity, with possible significant consequences on the safety of persons and property.   The organization will overcome the situation with serious difficulties (operation in a highly degraded mode), without any sector or state impact. |
| â€“ Critical | Disastrous consequences for the organization  Incapacity for the organization to ensure all or a portion of its activity, with possible serious consequences on the safety of persons and property.   The organization will most likely not overcome the situation (its survival is threatened), the activity sectors or state sectors in which it operates will likely be affected slightly, without any long-lasting consequences. |
| 5 â€“ Catastrophic | Sector or regulatory consequences beyond the organization Substantially impacted sector ecosystem(s), with consequences that can be long lasting.  And/or: difficulty for the State, and even an incapacity, to ensure a regulatory function or one of its missions of vital importance.  And/or: critical consequences on the safety of persons and property (health crisis, major environmental pollution, destruction of essential infrastructures, etc.). |

Table 3 Business Impact Matrix

Bayesâ€™s Theorem was then used to score risk likelihood.

Created by Reverend Thomas Bayes in 1763, the method provides a consistent and rationale way to solve the problem of how to update a belief in some uncertain event. It is well recognized for handling risk assessment, uncertainty, and decision making across multiple industries. (Fenton & Neil, 2013)

Bayesâ€™s Theorem is based on the following equation:

![Figure 10](/Modules/3/img/image_10.png)



Figure 3 Bayes's Theorem from ThinkBayes Downey(2022)



Downey (2022) explains the equation as follows:

p(A|B) refers to the probability of A given that B is true.

P(A) is the probability of A; p(B|A) is the probability of B given that A is true.

p(B) is the probability of B.

Sometimes, p(A) is called the prior probability.

p(A|B) is known as the posterior probability.

p(B|A) is known as the likelihood (especially when A denotes some data).

p(B) is known as the normalising constant.

Following Downeyâ€™s explanation, the methodology followed to determine qualitative scores for risk instance likelihood is shown below. To ensure probabilities are more realistic and accurate, we collected historical data or relevant industry benchmarks. We have assumed that relevant business data has been provided to complete values for (B), P(A), P(B|A) and P(B), and that this data was sourced from historical data, expert judgement or industry benchmarks. The posterior or updated likelihood score is determined in % by performing the following mathematical equation: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

![Figure 11](/Modules/3/img/image_11.png)



Figure 4 Bayes's Theorem Methodology for Risk Likelihood



Once a qualitative posterior % value is determined and recorded in the register, the likelihood was then scored using the following likelihood scoring matrix:



| Likelihood Score | Percentage Range |
|---|---|
| 1 Rare | 0 - 10% |
| 2 (Very Low) | >10% - 25% |
| 3 (Low) | >25% - 50% |
| 4 (Moderate) | >50% - 75% |
| 5 (High) | >75% - 100% |

Ensuring GDPR compliance involves addressing these risks through comprehensive data protection strategies, continuous monitoring, and regular audits to safeguard personal data against potential breaches and mishandling.

# ðŸ“˜ Business Continuity (BC)/Disaster Recover (DR) Strategy

All businesses should have plans for both BC and DR that are tested regularly. Having a disaster recovery solution is no longer a luxury but a business necessity (Badurdeen et al., 2014).

# ðŸ“˜ DR Strategy Requirements

Based on requirements provided by the business, an online shop Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of less than 1 hour, and a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of less than 1 minute is recommended.

This suggest a critical system requiring an active â€“ active solution that is highly recoverable quickly.

# ðŸ“˜ DR Solution Design

The following active-active design fulfils the requirements by having both sites run identical systems. If one system fails all users can be redirected to the other.

![Figure 13](/Modules/3/img/image_13.png)



Figure  Proposed Active-Active DR Design



The design is based on two systems running concurrently, one on premise and one in the cloud, or where each one is hosted on a separate cloud vendor environment. Either Microsoft Azure or AWS platforms are recommended. If one vendor platform is already in use, it recommended to choose the other.

Using a multi-cloud / multi-vendor environment cost more and is more complex but will avoid known risks including:

data lock-in where you may be charged by the provider to release or transfer your data

design lock-in where the use of single supplier-provided components can lead to applications having to be redesigned to be deployed on another platform

single supplier faults where one vendor issue can impact the solution regardless of numerous data centres in use or varying geographical location of the two systems

Any complex dependencies making up the solution must be identified early on and understood. For complex dependencies, the use of a reputable vendor is recommended, and that a vendor exit strategy is negotiated.

Additional design considerations making up the solution include:

The use of a cloud-based traffic manager managing the front-end traffic and monitoring both systems to detect if either fails and to manage automatic, seamless switchover.

Code deployment should follow a blue-green deployment strategy, where all users are switched over to one site to test new code, while the second site is held at the older version in case there are user errors with the new code.

Databases should be configured to provide high availability, disaster recovery, and read scale balancing such as Always On availability (AOAG) groups.

Any other data should be copied synchronously between systems. Synchronous copies ensure a fast, highly recoverable service although there may be a need for additional solutions to cope with data corruption as sync copies will copy corrupt data.

Applications should be deployed in stateless containers and all user-state managed via the database.

Applications must be designed as active - active ready to meet RPO/RTO

A global redundant storage option should be used ensuring a data copy is stored at least one 'paired' datacentre, preventing the risks posed by single building or local geography failure.



Such a design is costly but will provide immediate, tested, always on service.



# ðŸ“˜ Conclusion

The proposed digitalisation and internationalisation of Pampered Pets impacts on the businessâ€™s product quality and supply chain security risk landscape. By implementing robust quality control and suppler management, maturing the businesses cyber security and data privacy capabilities, and by implementing and maintaining an effective business continuity and disaster recovery strategy such as the ones proposed in this report, these risks can be mitigated effectively.
