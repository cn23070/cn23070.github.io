# üìã Development Team Project: Risk Identification Report



Development Team Project: Risk Identification Report

By: Olimpia Worku, Craig Norris and Mihail Poloboc.





# üìò Introduction

The report will follow a careful assessment of the current risk landscape of the Pampered Pets business; a prominent local pet food shop. The business has ambitious plans to expand internationally through digitisation, although wish to know the potential risks that could arise and mitigations to eliminate threats; alongside any recommendations. ISO 31000 will be used as a risk assessment methodology together with STRIDE and DREAD for assessing the risks before and after digitalisation of the Pampered Pets business; in order for the business to understand the current and future risk landscape they could be facing.





# üìò Risk assessment of the Pampered Pets business

There are several approaches to assessing risks; ISO 31000 is one of them. It is a comprehensive framework with international recognition that integrates well into other standards. ‚ÄãA study by Olechowski et al. (2016) suggests that the ISO 31000 standard for risk management has the potential to be a well-adopted and best-practice standard for project risk management. Similarly, Dali & Lajtha (2012) state that ISO 31000 has been adopted around the world by many G20 and BRICS countries; both cases imply that ISO 31000 is the most appropriate method for assessing risks for this particular business.

Furthermore, to conduct a thorough evaluation of the current threats and risks to the business, STRIDE will be used for threat modelling alongside DREAD for risk scoring. Although STRIDE and DREAD differ from each other as threat modeling methodologies, both aim to provide a structured framework for addressing security risks, additionally, both were developed by Microsoft (Shevchenko et al., 2018). STRIDE focuses on identifying and categorising threats, whereas the DREAD model at Microsoft is used to help calculate risk in the rating column of the DREAD rating table (Meier et al., 2003) (see Figure 1). STRIDE is used to represent six key threat categories (LeBlanc & Howard, 2002):



Spoofing identity: Unauthorised access; impersonating someone or something.

Tampering with data: Modification of data.

Repudiation: Users who deny action or event.

Information disclosure: Exposing information to unauthorised individuals.

Denial of service (DoS): Degrading service to authorised users.

Elevation of privilege: Gaining unauthorised access to compromise or damage the system.

After scoring the threat, one would count the values (1-3); the result can fall in the range of 5‚Äì15. The resulting risk rating is shown in Figure 2 (Meier et al., 2003).

The business's current digital infrastructure does face potential risks. At present, they use an old network computer and a wireless getaway alongside a hub where two computers used by the staff are connected. In addition, 90% of their business is carried out face-to-face. Upon review, the risks and threats identified that scored high on the risk score include malware, network sniffing and exploitation of outdated software along with other threats (see Figure 3). The attacker could compromise the front desk computer which could negatively impact orders and payments. In addition, there is a chance that the attacker could exploit a known vulnerability by acquiring administrative access to the front desk computer, allowing control of systems or data. Finally, since the store has poor network security configuration, it could allow unauthorised access to the customer‚Äôs details on the wireless network.



Additional issues include:

DoS attack

Phishing attack

Physical access

Lack of audit logs

Brute force credentials attack

Exploit outdated software (Integrity)



Furthermore, to mitigate these security risks, the business should consider anti-malware software as well as regular backups. Some claim that the use of malware detection software will automatically be able to identify any hostile and malicious threats in order to prevent damage to the business's system (Edward, Ebelogu & Ubaka, 2023). In addition, using strong encryption will enable a secure authentication between the devices and network of the store. Some argue about the importance of verifying the devices to provide secure access and control of a network; thus protecting the store (Friedman, 2016; Lokhande, Pooja, & Shah, 2021).

Overall, the digitalisation process has its benefits. For instance, it enables customers to shop online and, therefore, provides a convenient shopping experience. However, it could lead to an increased exposure to potential threats. Upon assessment, the risks have scored higher than before (see Figure 4). For instance:



Network sniffing- the store has poor network security configuration, thus allowing unauthorised access to the customer‚Äôs order details on the wireless network.

Lack of audit logs- the attackers could have the ability to deny order or payment submission.

Brute force credential attacks- the attacker could gain unauthorised access to sensitive data due to poor access control (e.g., tax records and inventory).



In order to mitigate them, the business might consider:

Implementing strong encryption protocols such as WPA 2 or perhaps WPA 3.

Implementing log entities such as user identities, timestamps, order details and payment information.

Implementing password policy and multifactor authentication (MFA).





# üìò Conclusion

Overall, the results indicate an increase in risk to the business if the decision to pursue digitisation is taken. Of course, an online presence could tremendously help the business grow, however, with the current high-risk vulnerabilities the store faces, as per industry best practice it is suggested to follow the recommended mitigations first before the digitalisation process.
