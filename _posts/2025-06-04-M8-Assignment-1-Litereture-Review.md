##Context, Perspective, and Theoretical Framework

###Context of the Topic

The integration of IoT in healthcare has improved diagnostics, patient monitoring, and real-time data analysis, enhancing patient outcomes. However, it has also widened the attack surface for cyber threats. Many Healthcare IoT (H-IoT) devices lack basic security features, making them vulnerable to ransomware, data breaches, and device hijacking (Badr et al., 2021; Kirubavathi et al., 2024). Weak credential practices, hard-coded passwords, and unencrypted communications are also common flaws exploited by attackers (Mej√≠a-Granda et al., 2023). These vulnerabilities not only compromise patient data but also endanger patient safety when critical devices are targeted (O‚ÄôBrien et al. ,2018).

A growing body of research emphasizes the urgent need for robust, scalable, and adaptive security frameworks tailored to the unique constraints of H-IoT environments. Threat intelligence and vulnerability data must be systematically leveraged to inform proactive defence mechanisms and policy development.

###Perspective and Framework

This review adopts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology to rigorously identify, evaluate, and analyse scholarly sources related to cybersecurity threats and AI/ML-based mitigation strategies in Healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT) systems. The approach follows a transparent and structured process, incorporating defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, comprehensive database searches, and critical appraisal of selected studies. By focusing on peer-reviewed articles within a specified timeframe, the review ensures academic rigor and facilitates the identification of key themes, trends, and research gaps. This framework ultimately aims to inform future research directions and contribute towards the development of robust, adaptive security solutions tailored to the complex and sensitive nature of healthcare IoT systems.

# üîç Methodology for Literature Selection

##Main Findings from the Literature

##Prevalent Threats and Vulnerabilities Identified

###Prevalent Threats

Several studies underscore the multifaceted nature of cyber threats facing H-IoT systems. Altulaihan et al. (2022) maps threats across architectural layers of H-IoT systems, reinforcing the need for layered defence strategies. Studies also highlight ransomware, phishing, and unauthorized access as dominant threats (Khatun et al., 2023; Kirubavathi et al., 2024). Also prominent was Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which can disrupt the availability of essential healthcare services (Khatun et al., 2023; Al-Hadhrami and Hussain, 2021; Rahman et al., 2024), and ransomware, which jeopardizes patient data confidentiality and system integrity (Sahu et al., 2020). Fereidouni et al. (2025) underscore vulnerabilities in communication protocols exploited via Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks. Additionally, the highly heterogeneous and resource-constrained nature of H-IoT devices exacerbates their susceptibility to exploitation through network-based attacks, such as man-in-the-middle and replay attacks (Altulaihan et al., 2022; Badr et al., 2021). Privacy breaches stemming from inadequate data protection mechanisms and insufficient regulatory compliance also emerge as critical challenges, given the sensitivity of healthcare data (Beaman et al., 2021).

###Known Vulnerabilities

During the COVID-19 pandemic, cyberattacks surged, exploiting vulnerabilities introduced by rapidly deployed digital health tools (Beaman et al., 2021). Legacy systems lacking basic encryption or authentication along with the valuable data they interact with also make healthcare networks highly attractive to cybercriminals (Beaman et al., 2021). Moreover, insider threats and insufficient user training contribute to the overall risk profile.

Research consistently highlights poor credential management, outdated firmware, and variety of devices and systems as major vulnerabilities (Khatun et al., 2023). Many devices do not consider security and privacy by design metrics, leading to inadequate password protocols and software patching, and end users continue to be the most vulnerable point in the security framework (Mej√≠a-Granda et al., 2023).

The absence of interoperability standards further increases risk through frequent misconfigurations (Badr et al., 2021). These threats are exacerbated by the lack of universal standards in H-IoT development, creating heterogeneity in device capabilities and security configurations (Badr et al., 2021; Khatun et al., 2023).

Looking to the future, Quantum computing is anticipated to break conventional encryption, presenting a future risk (Mansoor et al., 2025).

###Impact on Healthcare

Data breaches erode patient trust and expose providers to financial and legal consequences (IBM, 2024). Attacks during COVID-19, such as ransomware in critical care units, overwhelmed already stretched healthcare systems (Beaman et al., 2021). The mishandling of sensitive patient data by healthcare providers or their associated supply chains can result in significant data breaches, leading to substantial reputational harm and financial loss. The Ponemon Institute (2023) reports that the average cost of a data breach has reached USD 4.45 million, the highest on record. However, the financial repercussions can be even more severe under regulatory frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). As highlighted by Wolford (2022), organizations found in serious violation of GDPR may face penalties of up to ‚Ç¨20 million or 4% of their global annual turnover, whichever is greater. The risks extend beyond data breaches. Compromised devices like infusion pumps or ventilators pose direct patient safety risks (O‚ÄôBrien et al., 2018).

###Mitigation Strategies and Threat Intelligence Integration

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques are increasingly recognized as pivotal tools in advancing the cybersecurity posture of Healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT) systems (Khatun et al., 2023; ElSayed et al., 2024), particularly for proactive threat detection and mitigation. Mohamed, 2025 proposes a multilayered artificial intelligence framework that employs machine learning classifiers to detect anomalous network behaviour in Healthcare IoT (H-IoT) systems, enhancing threat detection through adaptive, data-driven analysis across multiple security layers. Complementing this, ElSayed et al. (2024) propose a hybrid lightweight ML model that effectively predicts cyber-attacks through anomaly detection tailored to resource constrained IoT devices, addressing the unique computational limitations intrinsic to H-IoT architectures. Khatun et al. (2023) provide a comprehensive review of ML approaches, underscoring the role of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms in recognising novel attacks, while emphasising the need for real-time processing and minimal false positives to preserve patient safety and data integrity. Furthermore, the paper from Jawahar et al., 2024 on integrated blockchain technology with deep learning to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks showcases how AI can complement cryptographic techniques for robust defence mechanisms. Badr et al. (2021) and Veeramakali et al. (2021) also highlight the symbiotic relationship between AI and blockchain in securing H-IoT, proposing intelligent frameworks that utilize AI for continuous threat intelligence and adaptive response strategies.

However, these studies also acknowledge critical challenges. The scarcity of publicly available, high-quality datasets for model training (Khatun et al., 2023; Altulaihan et al., 2022), the risk of adversarial machine learning attacks that can subvert AI models, and the complexity of integrating AI seamlessly into heterogeneous H-IoT infrastructures without compromising latency or reliability are all highlighted as challenges (Altulaihan et al., 2022; ElSayed et al., 2024). Collectively, the literature evidence that while AI/ML methods hold significant promise in enhancing H-IoT cybersecurity, ongoing research must address scalability, model robustness, and ethical considerations to realize their full potential within patient safety critical healthcare environments.

##Critical Evaluation

###Strengths of the Literature

The literature offers a strong conceptual foundation for understanding cyber threats to H-IoT. Several studies (e.g., Altulaihan et al., 2022; Badr et al., 2021) systematically classify threat types and defences, while others explore innovations like zero trust architectures and ML based anomaly detection (ElSayed et al., 2024).

Moreover, the recognition of post pandemic cybersecurity trends adds practical urgency and real-world relevance to the research (Beaman et al., 2021). The exploration of quantum risks, while speculative, positions the literature to anticipate future challenges before they become critical (Mansoor et al., 2025).

# ‚úÖ Conclusion and Research Gaps

## ‚úÖ Conclusions

This review underscores the growing complexity of cybersecurity threats in Healthcare IoT (H-IoT), driven by the rapid expansion of connected medical devices and sensitive data (Mej√≠a-Granda et al. (2023); Kirubavathi et al. (2024); Beaman et al. (2021)). AI and ML offer adaptive, real-time solutions that outperform traditional security methods, with current research highlighting hybrid models, blockchain integration, and anomaly detection (Rahman et al. (2024); ElSayed et al. (2024); Khatun et al. (2023)). Despite these advances, challenges such as data scarcity (Khatun et al. (2023); Altulaihan et al. (2022)), system heterogeneity (Fereidouni et al. (2025), latency (ElSayed et al. (2024), and adversarial risks (Beaman et al. (2021)) hinder real-world adoption. Closing the divide between technological innovation and practical implementation is crucial for protecting the healthcare infrastructures of the future.

##Identified Gaps and Future Research

The literature reveals several critical gaps that present opportunities for future research in securing Healthcare IoT (H-IoT) systems. One of the most pressing issues is the lack of large scale, labelled datasets representative of diverse healthcare environments, which are essential for training and validating effective AI/ML models (Khatun et al., 2023; Altulaihan et al., 2022). There is also a need to develop lightweight, real-time algorithms suited to the resource constraints of H-IoT devices (ElSayed et al., 2024). Adversarial machine learning remains underexplored, particularly in the context of healthcare specific threats (Beaman et al., 2021; Mansoor et al., 2025). Moreover, while AI blockchain integration shows promise, but empirical validation in real-world settings is limited (Jawahar et al., 2024; Veeramakali et al., 2021). Greater interdisciplinary focus is needed to address ethical and regulatory issues such as data privacy, governance, and algorithmic transparency. Finally, advancing adaptive architectures like AI driven Zero Trust models tailored for H-IoT represents a promising yet underdeveloped area (ElSayed et al., 2024).
