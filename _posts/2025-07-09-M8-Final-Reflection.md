# ðŸŽ“ Final Reflective Reflection â€“ Research Methods and Professional Practice

*Structured using Rolfe et al. (2001): What? â†’ So What? â†’ Now What?*

## ðŸ”¹ WHAT? â€“ Description of the Learning Events

This module provided a rich blend of theory, reflection, and applied learning that strengthened my academic confidence and practical readiness for dissertation research. 

I engaged in a variety of learning activities aimed at developing my competence in academic inquiry, research ethics, statistical analysis, and critical thinking. These included building a **literature review** on cybersecurity threats in IoT (Activity 3) and submitting it formally for assessment (Assignment 1). This experience allowed me to explore the academic treatment of topics I typically encounter in my professional role.

I subsequently developed a structured **research proposal** (Assignment 2), which introduced a refined research topic that I intend to expand upon in my MSc dissertation.

Ethical issues in computing were explored through reflective analysis of **Generative AI** (Activity 1) and the **Cambridge Analytica scandal** (Case Study), both of which raised critical questions about organisational accountability.

The **peer review seminar** (Activity 2) was particularly eye-opening, as it provided insight into how scholarly critique and collaboration function in a constructive academic environment.

Finally, the **statistics exercises** (Unit 6 Notes) highlighted important gaps in my analytical confidence, especially around data presentation, inferential reasoning, and sampling.

All of this was summarised in my **professional skills matrix and SWOT analysis** (Skills Matrix), helping me identify competencies Iâ€™ve strengthened and those I must still address.

## ðŸ”¹ SO WHAT? â€“ Interpretation of the Learning Experience

These activities taught me that academic rigour requires a level of methodical precision that is distinct from professional reporting. For instance, building the literature review made me appreciate the value of identifying theoretical gaps and synthesising multiple perspectives, rather than relying solely on practical heuristics.

The research proposal taught me how to frame research questions in a way that ensures measurability and ethical transparency. It also made me recognise how my professional assumptions can sometimes bias problem definitions, an awareness that will improve both my academic work and my professional leadership.

The peer review process helped me refine my ability to deliver and accept feedback, improving my confidence in academic discourse. It also reinforced the importance of tone and critical balance when reviewing the work of others â€” a skill often overlooked in workplace evaluations.

From an ethical standpoint, the case studies on Generative AI and Cambridge Analytica introduced me to structured ethical reasoning frameworks, expanding my thinking beyond policy compliance into the realm of social responsibility.

The statistical components, while challenging, were particularly meaningful. I realised that I lacked the analytical grounding to confidently interpret distributions and build inferences â€” a shortfall I would never have identified without this moduleâ€™s practical tasks.

Lastly, the requirement to reflect continuously encouraged me to think more intentionally about **how** I learn. The e-Portfolio process forced me to make connections between theoretical models and real-life application, enhancing both depth and transferability.

## ðŸ”¹ NOW WHAT? â€“ Application and Future Development

The skills developed in this module will directly inform and underpin my upcoming **MSc dissertation**, which I hope to base on the same research topic proposed in Assignment 2. This continuity will allow me to refine and extend my original methodology using the academic frameworks and ethical considerations explored throughout this module.

I now plan to:

- Use my **literature review structure** to refine my dissertation's background and theoretical framework.
- Build on my **research proposal**, improving the clarity of its objectives and validity of its methods.
- Apply ethical evaluation strategies when handling data collection, especially in designing consent, anonymity, and risk mitigation strategies.
- Carry forward the **statistical knowledge gained** to structure robust, evidence-based arguments, supported by tools such as Python or Excel for data visualisation.
- Maintain the habit of reflective journaling, which has proven valuable not only for academic clarity but for improving leadership awareness in my professional role.

To close the identified gaps, I have enrolled in a statistics course to improve my confidence in applying quantitative methods. I also intend to publish short reflective articles that connect academic research with industry practice and to mentor junior colleagues using simplified versions of these frameworks.

In short, this module has not only equipped me with the tools to produce a credible dissertation but has also elevated the academic quality of my thinking and practice.
