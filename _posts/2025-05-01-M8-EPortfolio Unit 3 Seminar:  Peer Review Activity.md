## Reflective Activity 2 Unit 3 Seminar Peer Review Activity

###  Summary overview of two papers selected

####  Paper 1 Blockchain and Lightweight Deep Learning-Based DDoS Mitigation Framework for H-IoT Security by ElSayed et al. (2025a)
Presents a decentralised security framework (combination of blockchain technology and lightweight deep learning model) designed to protect Healthcare IoT systems from DDoS attacks

####  Paper 2 Security and Privacy Threats in H-IoT: A Comprehensive Taxonomy, Challenges, and Future Directions by Alzahrani et al. (2024)
Provides a detailed and comprehensive taxonomy of security and privacy threats in healthcare IoT.

### Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research question of each paper. Are they in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic, contributing to the collective body of knowledge in this area?

####  Paper 1
Research Question: How can a decentralized framework combining blockchain and lightweight deep learning be designed to effectively detect and mitigate DDoS attacks in Healthcare IoT (H-IoT) environments while preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead? Contributes with  technical inovation, privacy by design, lightweight and scalable solution that can be expanded outside of just DDoS.

####  Paper 2
Research Question: What are the key security and privacy threats in Healthcare IoT systems, and how can these be systematically categorized to identify current challenges and guide future research directions?  COntributes with structured classifications of modern day security and privacy threats and highlights key IoT challenges around technical, regulatory and privacy

### Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the stated purpose or question? 

####  Paper 1
Yes, uses Design Science (well suited to solution -focused research) and Experimental Evaluation to test a hybrid security framework and validates it through simulation-based experiments. The use of quantitative experiments allows for objective evaluation of system effectiveness and overhead—critical in assessing suitability for real-world H-IoT use

Scope is limited to DDoS.

####  Paper 2
Yes, uses systematic Literature Review (SLR)(Ideal for addressing exploratory questions) and Taxonomical Analysis (provides theoretical and conceptual framework for future research and technology development). Does lack empirical data.

### In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or question? (We will discuss this further in upcoming units.)

####  Paper 1
Yes, system was evaluated using real-world datasets (e.g., CICIDS2017, CICDoS2016) and machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest) to assess detection accuracy and performance.

####  Paper 2
Yes, although lacking empirical data, the aim is not to validate a solution but to synthesize existing knowledge.


### Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?

####  Paper 1
Yes, with measurable evidence such as simulation results

####  Paper 2
Yes, paper provides a rigorous and systematic basis for all its claims, grounded in existing research.


### How would you enhance the work/paper?

####  Paper 1
Increase scope of threat coverage

####  Paper 2
Incorporate case studies, incident reports, or survey data
