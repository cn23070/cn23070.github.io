## Module 8: Study Notes

*Information about what I learnt during this module and how*

#### Unit 1

![Module Introduction](/Modules/8/img/1.png)

- **Figure 1**: Module Introduction (University of Essex Online, 2024)

In the first week of our unit on Research Methods, we explored the Scientific Method and ethical considerations in research. Key takeaways included understanding the purpose of research (explore, describe, explain (QuestionPro, 2021)), the importance of the scientific method for problem-solving (Andersen & Hepburn, 2020), and the two core types of reasoning: deductive and inductive (Miessler, D, 2018). 

![The Difference Between Deductive and Inductive Reasoning](/Modules/8/img/2.png)

- **Figure 2**: The Difference Between Deductive and Inductive Reasoning (Miessler, D, 2018)

Deductive reasoning moves from an idea to an observation, while inductive reasoning goes from an observation to an idea. Both are forms of inference, drawing conclusions based on evidence and reasoning. We also emphasized the importance of research ethics, requiring ethical approval before data collection, and highlighted key principles as described in the Menlo Report(2023) such as respect, beneficence, justice, and respect for law and public interest. 

Additionally, we learnt the significance of professionalism and ethics in computing.

"Ethical issues in computer science and information systems projects occur in three areas – how the research is performed, how you deal with participants and how you present your results." (Dawson, C, 2015) 

Key considerations include integrity, competence, and committment to public interest (British Computer Society (BCS), n.d.), especially in the age of generative AI.

#### Unit 2

In Week 2, we covered defining a research question, conducting a literature review, and presenting the review.

![Lecturecast: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal](/Modules/8/img/4b.png)

- **Figure 4**: Lecturecast: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal (University of Essex Online, 2025)

![Lecturecast: Understanding Research Questions](/Modules/8/img/5.png)

- **Figure 5**: Lecturecast: Understanding Research Questions (University of Essex Online, 2025)

A key lecturecast outcome was that a good research question focuses your project, sets boundaries, guides data collection and methods, and evolves iteratively (University of Essex Online, 2025).

![Lecturecast: Mind Maps to illustrate the process](/Modules/8/img/6.png)

- **Figure 6**: Lecturecast: Mind Maps to illustrate the process (University of Essex Online, 2025)

Mind Maps start with an interest, generate questions, guide investigation steps, and lead to new discoveries.

![Lecturecast: Research Question Guidelines](/Modules/8/img/7.png)

- **Figure 7**: Research Question Guidelines (University of Essex Online, 2025)

![Lecturecast: Assessing your working research questions](/Modules/8/img/8.png)

- **Figure 8**: Assessing your working research questions (University of Essex Online, 2025)

A key lecturecast learning outcome was that a good research question focuses your project, guiding readers to the specific subject within a broad topic. It sets boundaries, determines necessary data and methods, and evolves as you collect data. Developing research questions is an iterative process (University of Essex Online, 2025).

Also, a literature review critically evaluates sources to answer research questions and meet objectives. It involves comparing, contrasting, and discussing strengths and limitations. Literature is searched, assessed for relevance, and properly cited. It identifies relevant sources to inform data collection and potentially answer research questions. It highlights key ideas, strengths, limitations, and gaps in existing literature, ensuring relevance and value to the research project (University of Essex Online, 2025).

Sarantakos (2005) describes a literature review as a secondary analysis of existing information, placing the current study in its historical context. It involves finding various sources like reports, theses, journals, and databases (Saunders et al., 2012).

“...research questions turn a general purpose or aim into specific questions to which specific, data-driven, concrete, answers can be given” (Cohen et al., 2018)

![Lecturecast: Sections required for the Research Proposal](/Modules/8/img/11.png)

- **Figure 11**: Sections required for the Research Proposal (University of Essex Online, 2025)

Following on from the lecturecast we began a literature review for my chosen area of investigation.

#### Unit 3


In Week 3, we learned about research methods and how to plan a research project. 

They found out that researchers make certain assumptions about the world, knowledge, and personal values, which affect how they do research. 

Research design was explained as the plan for answering a research question. 

There were two main types: exploratory (to understand a problem better) and conclusive (to get clear answers). 

![Two Main Types Of Research](/Modules/8/img/12.png)

- **Figure 12**: Two Main Types Of Research (University of Essex Online, 2025)

Students also learned about three main research methods: qualitative (based on experiences), quantitative (based on numbers), and mixed methods (a mix of both). Data could be collected directly or from existing
 sources.
 
#### Unit 4

This unit introduced key qualitative data collection methods (case studies, focus groups, and observations), while also noting how some of these methods can be adapted for quantitative research. AN important point was that you may need to combine multiple methods to gather comprehensive data for your research.
 
 

| **Method**                | **Purpose**                                                                 | **Method Details**                                               | **Key Considerations**                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Case Studies**          | In depth exploration of individuals or groups to generate hypotheses.       | In depth research and study of individuals or groups.            | Not suitable for determining cause and effect. May suffer from researcher bias. Risk of weak generalizations due to atypical cases. Limited external validity. |
| **Focus Groups**          | Gather insights from a small, targeted group to answer “why,” “what,” “how”.| Group of people chosen to express their insights on the topic.   | Participants should share common backgrounds and experiences. Useful for understanding perceptions. Can also inform quantitative research.                    |
| **Quantitative Observation** | Collects numerical data (e.g., weight, volume, frequency).                  | Observing numerical values such as weight, volume, shape.        | Enables statistical analysis and objective measurement. Often involves surveys or experiments.                                                                |
| **Qualitative Observation** | Observes characteristics and behaviors in natural settings.                 | Monitoring of characteristics from a distance.                   | Respondents should be in a comfortable environment. Researcher may be a passive observer or an active participant.                                             |


#### Unit 5

In this unit we explored the foundational tools and techniques used in both qualitative and quantitative research, specifically focusing on interviews, surveys, and questionnaire design.
I now better understand the structure and purpose of questionnaires within surveys, and how to design effective questions. 

![Two Main Types Of Research](/Modules/8/img/14.png)

- **Figure 14**: Example data collection instruments aligned with different research goals (University of Essex Online, 2025)


The unit also introduced pre and post testing techniques, methods to improve response rates, and basic strategies for analyzing collected data. Through lectures, readings, and practical activities, I developed the skills to select appropriate tools for their investigations and design data collection instruments aligned with their research goals.

![Two Main Types Of Research](/Modules/8/img/15.png)

#### Unit 8

Unit 8 shifted the focus from statistical methods to the practical handling and presentation of data, both quantitative and qualitative. It explored the unique challenges of analyzing qualitative data—such as its subjective nature and the need for coding—and contrasted this with the structured approach of quantitative analysis. The unit also introduced data visualisation as a key tool for communicating insights effectively, highlighting the role of dashboards in business intelligence. Students learned how to choose appropriate charts for different data types and how to critically interpret visual data presentations. Activities included readings, peer discussions, completing a charts worksheet, and submitting a research proposal outline.

#### Unit 9

Unit 9 focused on three critical concepts in research design: validity, reliability, and generalisability. These elements determine the trustworthiness and applicability of research findings and must be considered before data collection begins. The unit clarified the distinction between reliability (consistency of measurement) and validity (accuracy and relevance of measurement), emphasizing that reliability is a prerequisite for validity. It also revisited the differences between qualitative and quantitative data, highlighting how each type should be analyzed and presented. Activities included a lecturecast, readings on data presentation, a charts worksheet, and a summary post in the discussion forum, all aimed at reinforcing the importance of designing robust and credible research.

#### Unit 10

Unit 10 introduced the essential skills of research writing, focusing on how to effectively structure and communicate a research project. The unit emphasized the importance of clear, structured writing for dissertations, research proposals, and potential publications. Students explored the key components of a dissertation—such as the introduction, literature review, methodology, and analysis—and learned strategies for approaching each section. The unit also brought together previous work on topic selection, literature review, and research design, culminating in Assignment 2: the creation of a research proposal presentation. Activities included a lecturecast, readings, submission of statistical worksheets, and the development of a presentation with a transcript.


#### Unit 11

Unit 11 focused on professional development through the completion and reflection on your e-Portfolio. This unit emphasized the value of e-portfolios as tools for showcasing your learning journey, supporting career development, and enhancing employability. Students were encouraged to reflect on their learning across the programme, complete a Professional Skills Matrix, and develop an action plan for future growth. The unit also introduced the Learning Loop, a reflective tool to evaluate personal and academic progress. Activities included readings on the use of e-portfolios, seminar discussions, and preparation for the final e-Portfolio submission in Unit 12.

#### Unit 12

During the final unit of the module we were introduced to the principles of project management with a focus on managing risk and change throughout the project life cycle. Students explored the nature of computing projects, the importance of selecting appropriate project methodologies, and the need for flexibility in managing evolving project requirements. The unit emphasized that no project is risk free and highlighted the importance of identifying, assessing, and planning for potential risks. It also covered the use of change control processes to manage project scope, cost, and timelines effectively. Activities included readings on project and risk management, a self-assessment quiz, and the final submission of the individual e-Portfolio with a reflective piece.

### Module 8: Other Notes

#### Unit 1

##### Purpose of Research:

- Explore: Gain familiarity with a topic or situation.
- Describe: Detail your findings.
- Explain: Address the question "why?" (QuestionPro, 2021).

##### Research Approach:

- Follow the scientific method: Hypothesis formulation, reasoning, and testing, crucial for problem-solving (Andersen & Hepburn, 2020).

##### Types of Reasoning:

###### Deductive Reasoning:

- Idea → Observation → Conclusion.
- Example: "All men are mortal" → "Jason is a man" → "Jason is mortal."
- Moves from idea to observation.
- Perfect conclusions if assumptions are 100% correct.
- Harder to use outside lab settings due to lack of fully agreed-upon facts.

###### Inductive Reasoning:
- Observation → Analysis → Theory.
- Example: "I break out when I eat peanuts" → "Symptom of being allergic" → "I am allergic to peanuts."
- Moves from observation to idea.
- Useful for everyday problems with partial information.
- Practical but conclusions may not always be right.

##### Inference:

- Both deduction and induction involve drawing conclusions based on evidence and reasoning.

##### Research Ethics:

- Crucial for all research, especially involving people.
- Ethical approval required before collecting data or conducting primary research.
- Applies to both qualitative (interviews, focus groups) and quantitative (experiments, questionnaires) research.
- Necessary for secondary data if it includes sensitive or personal information.
- Permission needed for non-freely accessible secondary data.

##### Key Principles of Research Ethics (Menlo Report):

**Respect**: Voluntary participation, consent, and anonymity.
**Beneficence**: Balance benefits and risks for participants.
**Justice**: Equal treatment and fair distribution of research benefits.
**Respect for Law and Public Interest**: Legal due diligence, accountability, integrity, quality, and transparency.
**Ethics vs. Morals**: Both concern 'right' and 'wrong' but differ in context.

Ethics in Computing ncludes additional considerations in the age of generative AI.

##### Professionalism:

- Essential in all research areas. BCS Code of Conduct provides guidance on professionalism, data protection, and intellectual property.
