- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: prevalence and impact in healthcare IoT
- Other Attacks: prevalence and impact in healthcare IoT

ElSayed, Z., Abdelgawad, A. and Elsayed, N., 2025. Cybersecurity and Frequent Cyber Attacks on IoT Devices in Healthcare: Issues and Solutions. arXiv preprint arXiv:2501.11250.

	-- Key Ideas: Survey major attack vectors (Malware / Ransomware, DDoS ...) affecting IoT in heatlhcare
	-- Strengths: Up to date with recent examples and covers both oerational and technical security areas. COvers real world medical devices 
    -- Limitations: Mitigation solutions are high level and do not cover detailed implementation guidance or metrics.
	-- Gaps: Lacks empirical testing or data-driven models. No threat intelligence data use for things like systemic classification of threats.
	
*Vulnerabilities in IoT Devices*

- Device Security Flaws: Studies covering common security flaws in IoT devices
- Network Security Issues: Studies covering common network security flaws relevant to IoT Healthcare devices
	
Dzamesi, L. and Elsayed, N., 2025. A Review on the Security Vulnerabilities of the IoMT against Malware Attacks and DDoS. arXiv preprint arXiv:2501.07703.	

	-- Key Ideas: Focused research on vulnerabilities (especially malware an ddistributed attacks) affecting IoT in heatlhcare. Explores device and network level.
	-- Strengths: Detailed breakdown of attack types specific to Healthcare IoT, highlighting interdependancies between systems and networks. 
    -- Limitations: Focused on types of attack rather then detection or mitifation strategies.
	-- Gaps: No discussion of threat intelligence usage and does not integrate into existing frameworks or tools (e.g. CVE, MITRE ...) for mitigation


*Impact on Healthcare*

- Patient Safety: Impact analysis from cyber threats
- Operational / Regulatory / Other: Studies covering impacts caused by cyberattacks on IoT devices
- Financial Implications: Financial impact analysis covering cybersecurity data breeches in Healthcare

Luna, R., Rhine, E., Myhra, M., Sullivan, R. and Kruse, C.S., 2016. Cyber threats to health information systems: A systematic review. Technology and Health Care, 24(1), pp.1-9.

	-- Key Ideas: Focused on electronic health records and data integrity, not device-level IoT. Provides a summary of prior studies that cover healthcare cybersecurity threats.
	-- Strengths: Strong systemic review methodology and highlights key / relevant risk vectors  
    -- Limitations: Old paper (2016) that does not address modern day IoT complexities and is not device specific.
	-- Gaps: No threat intelligence integation and limited applicability to IoT enviroments.
