## Module 3: Summary Reflection

When taking on the module Security and Risk Management I was excited to learn more about the various risk management methodologies and best practices followed across industry, especially looking at both qualitative and quantitative methods and what each approach brings. Although I had experience in designing, implementing and running risk management frameworks for large business in the run up to this module, much of what I had done to date was based around ISO frameworks only using qualitative methods for risk scoring. 


![Module Introduction](/Modules/3/img/9.png)

I was a little apprehensive about delving into the quantitative space, anticipating challenges around grasping the mathematical aspects involved in performing such assessments and slightly concerned around how their complexity would impact on real life risk modelling exercises. Through this reflection, I aim to share the various experiences and knowledge gained by completing this module.

### Units 1,2 & 3: Finding Your Risk Feet


We began with applicable background reading used to research enterprise risk management models. Unit 1 and 2 provided a lecturecast that covered each learning objective in detail. Through the lecturecast I learnt of key terminology used in risk, and further developed my understanding on risk definitions by looking at the evolution of the definition over time and how context and situation influences the definition. Lecturecast also introduced myself to the OpenFAIR and OCTAVE Framework’s. 

Key takeaways were around risk definition, common frameworks in use, and finally a comparison of the qunatative and qualitative methodologies

#### Risk definition

Reim, Parida, and Sjödin (2016) define risk “as a combination of the probability of loss and the impact of the loss for a number of events and risks”.

![Risk Definition During Lecturecast1](/Modules/3/img/1.png)

My simplified version of this is that risk is the probability that something may occur, and is based on the impact an likelihood of the occurrence.

![Risk Definition During Lecturecast1](/Modules/3/img/2.png)

#### Qualatitive vs. Quantatative methods:

![Qualitative vs. Quantative During Lecturecast1](/Modules/3/img/3.png)

##### Qualatitive method:

Used for lower value assets, or numerical data is missing, or when risk stakeholders do not have quatative assessment skillsets
Threats and vulnerabilities are ususally assigned a value of high, medium or low

##### Quantatative method:

Well defined mathematical calculation that often uses proability and game theory 

Hubbard(2009) argues that quantative assessments are more useful then qualitative assessments and should be preferred.

However Busch(n.d.) points out not all risks can be evaluated numerically. This is becuase risk is subjective, and precluding qualitative assessment may exclude useful input from less numerically oriented staff. is that risk is not easy to define, as the definition if often dependant on context and situation. One of the challenges of risk management is ensuring that all key stakeholders share a common understanding of risk.


#### Threat Modeling with STRIDE, DREAD, and Attack Trees


Unit 3 then provided an introduction to threat modelling. During the lecturecast we learnt the difference between threats and vulnerabilities and reviewed several common threat modelling techniques.

To further support my understanding of the different threat models and their features, I also reviewed a paper by Shevchenko et al (2018) that summarized the most common threat management and modelling methods currently in use

Unit 4 allowed us to gain experience of the some of the more common threat modelling techniques (STRIDE and DREAD, Attack Trees), by researching them in more detail, attempting to apply them to a scenario, and then discussing them during the unit 4 group seminar.

I decided to perform a rapid threat assessment with the aid of ChatGPT. I generated a couple threat models using STRIDE, DREAD, and attack trees.

During Unit 5 we studied several case studies from 2014 – 2018 concerning GDPR related issues and breaches by references content on the Data Protection Commission (2020) Case Studies: Data Protection Commission website. 

I came away with some exerpiance around the different aspects of GDPR that can have issues and how to resolve them.

### Units 4, 5 & 6: Gaining Experiance and Applying Inital Leanrings

Equiped with a clear understanding of risk management,including best practice methodologies and frameworks that help you perform it successfully, the module content and activities turned to gaining experience. 

Unit 4 allowed us to gain experiance of the some of the more common threat modelling techniques (STRIDE and DREAD, Attack Trees), by researching them in more detail, attempting to apply them to a scenario, and then discussing them during the uniit 4 group seminar. 

During Unit 5 we studied several case studies from 2014 – 2018 concerning GDPR related issues and breaches by references content on the Data Protection Commission (2020) Case Studies: Data Protection Commission website. 

I came away with some exerpiance around the different aspects of GDPR that can have issues and how to resolve them.

During unit 6 we then submitted a group assignment where two peers and I carried out a risk assessment and provided a report for the fictional business Pampered Pets; a prominent local pet food shop. 

The business has ambitious plans to expand internationally through digitization, and we were tasked to report on potential risks that could arise and mitigations to eliminate threats; alongside any recommendations. 

![Risk Proccess Step 1: Establish Context](/Modules/3/img/8.png)

We used ISO 31000 as a risk assessment methodology together with STRIDE and DREAD for assessing the risks before and after digitalization of the Pampered Pets business. 

![Risk Proccess based on ISO 31000](/Modules/3/img/6.png)

![Risk Register with analysis using STRIDE and DREAD](/Modules/3/img/12.png)

Our group faced challenges including two thirds of the members being part time students whilst being full time employed. 

I learnt to deal with this by setting expectations up front using a team contract and establish operating mechanisms for collaboration early was key to our success. 

![Group Assignment Team Contract](/Modules/3/img/11.png)

I liked taking onboard my peers input and found that allowing a platform for candid open collaboration that is grounded by a simple operating framework agreed up front delivers strong results.

The exercise was fun and resulted in a grade of 80%, giving me confidence for future group exercises including assignments. 

![Group Assignment Results](/Modules/3/img/10.png)


### Units 7 & 8: Delving Deeper Into Quantitative Risk Modelling

It was now time to takle my initial concerns around quantitative methods head on by first learning more about them followed by gaining experience by using them.

![Delving Deeper Into Quantitative Risk Modelling](/Modules/3/img/13.png)

We carried out pratcial exercises that involved applying the most common modelling types: Monte Carlo, Bayes Theorom. We then discussed the results during the live seminars.

I really enjoyed challenging myself to grasp these methods. 


### Units 9: The Importance of Business COntinuity(BC)/Disaster Recovery(DR)

Unit 9 then equipped us with a great understanding of business continuity and disaster recovery. 

![DR and Digitalisation](/Modules/3/img/14.png)

We learnt about the importance of having such a strategy in place, and what the main factors are that make up a BC/DR plan including RTOs and RPOs.

![RTO (Recovery Time Objective) & RPO (Recovery Point Objective)](/Modules/3/img/15.png)

### Final Units 10, 11 & 12: Testing My Learnings & Looking to the SRM Future


During the final few units we had the opportunity to take the knowledge gained and gain more experience applying it through an executive summary assignment.

This report evaluated Pampered Pets again, but this time focused on the potential product quality and availability risks associated with the digitisation and internationalisation of the Pampered Pets business including the introduction of an international supply chain and automated warehouses worldwide. 

Additionally, it provides a GDPR regulatory analysis and outlines a business continuity / disaster recovery strategy to help ensure a 24/7 digital e-commerce customer service capability.

![Risk Proccess Step 1: Establish Context](/Modules/3/img/16.png)

Here I had the opportunity to apply Bayeses' Theorem in a risk analysis exercise in order to determine probability of risk occurrence 

![Applying Bayes's Theorem](/Modules/3/img/17.png)

![Risk Proccess Step 2: Risk Analysis](/Modules/3/img/18.png)

![Risk Proccess Step 3: Regulatory Impact Analysis](/Modules/3/img/20.png)

I also got to create and submit a BC/DR design proposal for a a critical system requiring an active – active solution that is highly recoverable quickly.

![BC/DR Pampered Pets Proposal](/Modules/3/img/19.png)

####Unit 12: What Next? The Future Trends in SRM

![Key Questions](/Modules/3/img/21.png)

We then concluded the module with a look at the future trends in security and risk management. Learning the current and emerging trends was insightful and something I will take away into my current risk work activities.

## Conclusion


In conclusion this module has equipped me with a solid foundation in security and risk management including business continuity and disaster recover. 
I understand the importance of and the best practice around how to apply the right risk framework and methodology based on the context being assessed. 
Importantly I also now know the value of implementing and maintaining a business continuity / disaster recovery strategy that is based around requirements including known risks the strategy should address. 
I have a lot to learn still around quantitative risk analysis having only produced one assessment using Bayes Theorem to date, but I am confident in my ability to start applying this now in the risk work I am doing during my current employment as a Director of Cyber Security. 
I also come away with further reassurance on the important role risk management plays in helping ensure a business achieves its goals and objectives.

### Unit 1&2: An Introduction to Security and Risk Management, & Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process


#### Unit 1&2: Reflections

Unit 1 provided a lecturecast that covered each learning objective in detail. Through the lecturecast I learnt a number of key terminology used in risk, and further developed my understanding on risk definitions by looking at the evolution of the definition over time and how context and situation influences the definition.The Lecturecast also introduced myself to the OpenFAIR and OCTAVE Framework's.
We also reviewed our first case study, a paper by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019),that illustrates some of the risks introduced by industry 4.0 when applying digitalisation to more traditional business processes. The study also covered a methodology for carrying out the risk assessment of the digitalisation process as well as some common definitions of risk.
Industry 4.0. it refers to the fourth industrial revolution and embodies the use of new technologies like the Internet of things (IoT), big data, cloud computing, robotics, and artificial intelligence, to transform traditional and manufacturing processes.
It aims to enhance and optimize manufacturing and industrial operations by decentralising communication between humans and machines and enabling autonomous collaboration between machines, devices and systems. (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019).


#### Understand the various definitions of risk.

- **1**: Learning about Risk Definition

![Risk Definition During Lecturecast1](/Modules/3/img/1.png)

On completion of unit 1 I came away with a good understanding of what risk is, including the various definitions it known by.

A key takeaway is that risk is not easy to define, as the definition if often dependant on context and situation. One of the challenges of risk management is ensuring that all key stakeholders share a common understanding of risk.

Reim, Parida, and Sjödin (2016) define risk “as a combination of the probability of loss and the impact of the loss for a number of events and risks”. 

My simplified version of this is that risk is the probability that something may occur, and is based on the impact an likelihood of the occurrence.

![Risk Definition During Lecturecast1](/Modules/3/img/2.png)

#### Ability to explain how to assess, qualify and mitigate risks

![Risk Definition During Lecturecast1](/Modules/3/img/4.png)

In order for a company to assess, qualify and mitigate risks appropriately, a risk management system program should be implemented made up of:
- appropriatte governance, buy-in and contribution from senior management and involve the senior leaders of all major departments within the company
- all known appropriate standards and certifications that the company is required to be compliant with from both a legal and regulatory perspective
- continous improvmenet following the PDCA model
- be integrated with the companys information security management system


#### Describe various approaches to quantify and qualify risks.

- **1**: Learning about qualitative vs. quantative

![Qualitative vs. Quantative During Lecturecast1](/Modules/3/img/3.png)

**Qualatitive:**
- Used for lower value assets, or numerical data is missing, or when risk stakeholders do not have quatative assessment skillsets
- Threats and vulnerabilities are ususally assigned a value of high, medium or low

**Quantative:**
- Well defined mathematical calculation that often uses proability and game theory

Hubbard(2009) argues that quantative assessments are more useful then qualitative assessments and should be preferred. 

However Busch(n.d.) points out not all risks can be evaluated numerically. This is becuase risk is subjective, and precluding qualitative assessment may exclude useful input from less numerically oriented staff. 

#### List common security and risk standards and select the appropriate one(s) for a given situation.

The Lecturecast also introduced myself to a number of standards including the OpenFAIR and OCTAVE Framework's.

**OpenFAIR**
Open FAIR is a standard produced by the Open Group  
FAIR is an acronym for "Factor Analysis of Information Risk" (Josey et al, 2014). 
It consists of two documents, the open risk taxonomy (O-RT) which defines the taxonomy for the factors driving information risk; and the open risk analysis (O-RA) which describes the process and procedures associated with performing risk analysis.

**OCTAVE**
OCTAVE stands for Operationally Critical Threat, Asset and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE) framework standard 
The standard was created at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 1999 (Alberts et al, 1999)
Made up of three phases: 1 Build enterprise wide security requirements, 2 Identify infrastructure vulnerabilties, and 3 determine the security risk management strategy

#### Unit 3,4 & 5: Threat Modelling and Management, and Security and Risk Standards in Industry and the Enterprise

Unit 3 provided an introduction to threat modelling. the lecturecast we learnt the difference between threats and vulnerabilities and reviewed a number of common threat modelling techniques.

![Key Terminology](/Modules/3/img/5.png)

#### Common Threat Models and Features (Shevchenko et al, 2018)

To further support my uderstanding of the different threat models and their features, I also reviewed a paper by Shevchenko et al (2018) that summarised the most common threat management and modelling methods currently in use which is summarised in the table below.

| Threat Modelling Method                        | Features|
| :--------                                      | :-------|
| STRIDE										 | Helps identify relevant mitigating techniques, Is the most mature, Is easy to use but is time consuming|      
| PASTA 									     | Helps identify relevant mitigating techniques, Directly contributes to risk management, Encourages collaboration among stakeholders, Contains built-in prioritization of threat mitigation, Is laborious but has rich documentation|
| LINDDUN   									 | Helps identify relevant mitigation techniques, Contains built-in prioritization of threat mitigation, Can be labor intensive and time consuming |
| CVSS 											 | Contains built-in prioritization of threat mitigation, Has consistent results when repeated, Automated components, Has score calculations that are not transparent |      
| Attack Trees									 | Helps identify relevant mitigation techniques, Has consistent results when repeated, Is easy to use if you already have a thorough understanding of the system |
| Persona non Grata 							 | Helps identify relevant mitigation techniques, Directly contributes to risk management, Has consistent results when repeated, Tends to detect only some subsets of threats |
| Security Cards 								 | Encourages collaboration among stakeholders, Targets out-of-the-ordinary threats, Leads to many false positives |
| hTMM	                                         | Contains built-in prioritization of threat mitigation, Encourages collaboration among stakeholders, Has consistent results when repeated |
| Quantitative TMM							     | Contains built-in prioritization of threat mitigation, Has automated components, Has consistent results when repeated |
| Trike											 | Helps identify relevant mitigation techniques, Directly contributes to risk management , Contains built-in prioritization of threat mitigation, Encourages collaboration among stakeholders, Has automated components, Has vague, insufficient documentation |
| VAST Modeling 								 | Helps identify relevant mitigation techniques, Directly contributes to risk management, Contains built-in prioritization of threat mitigation, Encourages collaboration among stakeholders, Has consistent results when repeated, Has automated components, Is explicitly designed to be scalable, Has little publicly available documentation|
| OCTAVE 	                                     | Helps identify relevant mitigation techniques, Directly contributes to risk management, Contains built-in prioritization of threat mitigation, Encourages collaboration among stakeholders, Has consistent results when repeated, Is explicitly designed to be scalable, Is time consuming and has vague documentation |

####  Intial Threat Modeling with STRIDE, DREAD, and Attack Trees

Unit 4 allowed us to gain experiance of the some of the more common threat modelling techniques (STRIDE and DREAD, Attack Trees), by researching them in more detail, attempting to apply them to a scenario, and then discussing them during the uniit 4 group seminar. 

I decided to perform a rapid threat assessment with the aid of ChatGPT. I generated a couple threat models using STRIDE, DREAD, and attack trees for the following **scenario: *a large medical device manufacturer based in the United States of America.*** 

Example results are shown below and were discussed with my lecturer and peers. 

Each node shown represents a threat actors goal or method to achieve that goal. This helps to identify where security measures should be implemented to mitigate risks, and aids in understanding and prioritizing risks.

![Example Attack Tree Exercise Results](/Modules/3/img/7.png)

**STRIDE Threat Model Exercise Results**

**1. Spoofing Identity**
- **Threat:** An attacker impersonates an authorized user or system.
- **Example:** Attacker uses stolen credentials to access the network.
- **Mitigation:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong access controls.
 
**2. Tampering with Data**
- **Threat:** An attacker tampers with data, compromising its integrity.
- **Example:** An insider modifies patient records or medical device calibration data.
- **Mitigation:** Use encryption, digital signatures, audit log reviews, and regular integrity checks.
 
**3. Repudiation**
- **Threat:** Actions or transactions can be denied by users.
- **Example:** An employee denies making changes to sensitive patient data after changing it.
- **Mitigation:** Implement audit logging including log reviews.
 
**4. Information Disclosure**
- **Threat:** Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability to access confidential patient data.
- **Mitigation:** Use encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments.
 
**5. Denial of Service (DoS)**
- **Threat:** An attacker disrupts services to make them unavailable.
- **Example:** A DDoS attack on the company's servers disrupts manufacturing operations.
- **Mitigation:** Deploy DoS protection mechanisms like firewalls and redundancy.
 
**6. Elevation of Privilege**
- **Threat:** An attacker gains unauthorized elevated privileges.
- **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability to gain administrative access to the system.
- **Mitigation:** Implement least privilege access controls and regular patching.

#### Units 4,5 & 6: Gaining Experiance with Assignment 1

Unit 3 provided an introduction to threat modelling. the lecturecast we learnt the difference between threats and vulnerabilities and reviewed a number of common threat modelling techniques.

Units 4, 5 and 6 equipped with a clear understanding of risk management and the best practice methodologies and frameworks that help you perform it successfully, the module content and activities turned to gaining experience on risk management techniques by applying what we had learnt to date along with delving deeper into some of the topics themselves. 

During Unit 5 we studied several case studies from 2014 – 2018 concerning GDPR related issues and breaches by references content on the Data Protection Commission (2020) Case Studies: Data Protection Commission website. 

I came away with some exerpiance around the different aspects of GDPR that can have issues and how to resolve them.

We concluded unit 6 by submitting  a group assignment where two peers and I carried out a risk assessment and provided a report for the fictional business Pampered Pets; a prominent local pet food shop. 

The business has ambitious plans to expand internationally through digitization, and we were tasked to report on potential risks that could arise and mitigations to eliminate threats; alongside any recommendations.

We used ISO 31000 as a risk assessment methodology together with STRIDE and DREAD for assessing the risks before and after digitalization of the Pampered Pets business. 

![Risk Proccess based on ISO 31000](/Modules/3/img/6.png)

![Risk Register with analysis using STRIDE and DREAD](/Modules/3/img/12.png)

The exercise was fun and resulted in a grade of 80%, giving me confidence for future group exercises including assignments. 

![Group Assignment Results](/Modules/3/img/10.png)

Our group faced challenges including  two thirds of the members being part time students whilst being full time employed. 

I learnt to deal with this by setting expectations up front using a team contract, and establish operating mechanisms for collaboration early was key to our success. 

![Group Assignment Team Contract](/Modules/3/img/11.png)

I liked taking onboard my peers input and found that allowing a platform for candid open collaboration that is grounded by a simple operating framework agreed up front delivers strong results.

#### Units 7 & 8: Delving Deeper Into Quantitative Risk Modelling

Unit 7 and 8 allowed me to takle my initial concerns around quantitative methods head on by first learning about them in more detail followed by gaining experience around using them.

![Delving Deeper Into Quantitative Risk Modelling](/Modules/3/img/13.png)


Experiance was gained carrying out pratcial exrcises that involved applying the most common modelling types: Monte Carlo, Bayes Theorom. We then discussed the results during the live seminars.

I really enjoyed challenging myself to grasp these methods. 


####Unit 9: The Importance of Business Continuity(BC)/Disaster Recovery(DR)

Unit 9 then equipped us with a great understanding of business continuity and disaster recovery. 

![DR and Digitalisation](/Modules/3/img/14.png)

We learnt about the importance of having such a strategy in place, and what the main factors are that make up a BC/DR plan including RTOs and RPOs.

![RTO (Recovery Time Objective) & RPO (Recovery Point Objective)](/Modules/3/img/15.png)

####Units 10 & 11: Putting It All Together - An Executive Summary Assignment, and whats next for Risk

During the final few units we had the opportunity to take the knowledge gained and gain more experience applying it through an executive summary assignment.

This report evaluated Pampered Pets again, but this time focused on the potential product quality and availability risks associated with the digitisation and internationalisation of the Pampered Pets business including the introduction of an international supply chain and automated warehouses worldwide. 

Additionally, it provides a GDPR regulatory analysis and outlines a business continuity / disaster recovery strategy to help ensure a 24/7 digital e-commerce customer service capability.

![Risk Proccess Step 1: Establish Context](/Modules/3/img/16.png)

Here I had the opportunity to apply Bayeses' Theorem in a risk analysis exercise in order to determine probability of risk occurrence 

![Applying Bayes's Theorem](/Modules/3/img/17.png)

![Risk Proccess Step 2: Risk Analysis](/Modules/3/img/18.png)

![Risk Proccess Step 3: Regulatory Impact Analysis](/Modules/3/img/20.png)

I also got to create and submit a BC/DR design proposal for a a critical system requiring an active – active solution that is highly recoverable quickly.
